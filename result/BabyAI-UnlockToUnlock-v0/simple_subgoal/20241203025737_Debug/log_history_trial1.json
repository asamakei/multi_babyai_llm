  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (15, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (15, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.",
