    "To complete the task of picking up the box, I plan to first move north to avoid the wall at (4, 5) and Agent1. Then, I will move east to reach the green locked door at (5, 4) and use the green key to open it. After opening the door, I will move forward to enter the new area and head north to reach the purple box at (8, 1). I will avoid going south as it leads to a wall and focus on exploring the east and north paths to find the box.",
    "To complete the task, I would start by turning left to face east and then move forward to the cell (4, 4) where Agent0 is located. Then, I would turn right to face south and move forward to the cell (4, 5), but since there is a wall, I would turn left to face east and move forward to the cell (5, 4) where the green locked door is located. Next, I would move around the door by turning right to face south and then left to face east, and continue moving forward to the cell (5, 3) and then (5, 2) to reach the cell where the box is located. Finally, I would pick up the box to accomplish my mission."
