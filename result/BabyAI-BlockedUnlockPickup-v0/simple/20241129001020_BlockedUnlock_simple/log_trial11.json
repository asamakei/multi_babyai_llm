You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I plan to start by moving east and then south to reach the purple open door at (5, 3), but first, I will explore the area to find the purple key to unlock the door. After obtaining the key, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will use the key to unlock the purple locked door if necessary and be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference. If I encounter any obstacles or dead ends, I will re-route my path and adjust my plan accordingly to ensure the successful completion of the task.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by turning right to face east and move forward to the space at (2, 1) to avoid agent1, then move forward again to the space at (3, 1) to pick up the purple key. After obtaining the key, I will move east to the purple locked door at (5, 3) and use the key to unlock it. Next, I will move through the door to reach the green box at (8, 1) and pick it up to complete the task. I will be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference.\nTrial 2:\nI will start by turning left to face north and moving forward to the space at (6, 3), then move north to reach the space at (6, 2) to avoid agent1, and continue north to the space at (6, 1). Next, I will move east to reach the green box at (8, 1) and pick it up to complete the task. I will be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference and adjust my plan accordingly to ensure the successful completion of the task.\n\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible",

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

After obtaining the key, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will use the key to unlock the purple locked door if necessary and be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference. If I encounter any obstacles or dead ends, I will re-route my path and adjust my plan accordingly to ensure the successful completion of the task.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by turning right to face east and move forward to the space at (2, 1) to avoid agent1, then move forward again to the space at (3, 1) to pick up the purple key. After obtaining the key, I will move east to the purple locked door at (5, 3) and use the key to unlock it. Next, I will move through the door to reach the green box at (8, 1) and pick it up to complete the task. I will be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference.\nTrial 2:\nI will start by turning left to face north and moving forward to the space at (6, 3), then move north to reach the space at (6, 2) to avoid agent1, and continue north to the space at (6, 1). Next, I will move east to reach the green box at (8, 1) and pick it up to complete the task.
