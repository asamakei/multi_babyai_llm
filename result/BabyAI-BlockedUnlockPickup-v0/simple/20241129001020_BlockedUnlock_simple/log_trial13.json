Before picking up the green box, I would drop the purple key to ensure I don't have any items in my possession. Once I reach the correct position and drop the key, I would pick up the green box to complete the task, focusing on the most direct path to the box to save time.\n\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 0:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\". You are looking at south. You are at (2, 4). Your forward is (2, 5). Your right is (1, 4) Your left is (3, 4). You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 5). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (0, 5). There is wall at (5, 4). There is wall at (0, 4). Agent0 facing west is at (3, 3). There is wall in your forward coordinate (2, 5). There is no object in your right coordinate (1, 4). There is no object in your left coordinate (3, 4).\nYour think:To accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid Agent0, but since there's a wall in the forward direction, I would turn left to face east and move forward to reach a passable area. Then, I would assess the new situation and plan the next steps to reach the box while keeping an eye on Agent0's position.\n\nYou are agent1. What is the best action to achieve your task in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'? Output only result.\n><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nturn left"
