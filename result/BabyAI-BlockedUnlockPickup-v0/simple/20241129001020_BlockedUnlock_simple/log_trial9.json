I will use the key to unlock the purple locked door if necessary and be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference. If I encounter any obstacles or dead ends, I will re-route my path and adjust my plan accordingly to ensure the successful completion of the task.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by turning right to face east and move forward to the space at (2, 1) to avoid agent1, then move forward again to the space at (3, 1) to pick up the purple key.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

Next, I will move forward to the space at (2, 2) to pick up the yellow ball and drop it to free up my hands. After that, I will move forward to the space at (3, 3) to pick up the purple key, then move back to the purple locked door at (5, 3) and use the key to unlock it.

I will use the key to unlock the purple locked door if necessary and be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference. If I encounter any obstacles or dead ends, I will re-route my path and adjust my plan accordingly to ensure the successful completion of the task.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by turning right to face east and move forward to the space at (2, 1) to avoid agent1, then move forward again to the space at (3, 1) to pick up the purple key.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid Agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the box. Next, I would move left to reach the correct y-coordinate of the box while keeping an eye on Agent0's position to avoid any potential interference. Once I reach the correct position, I would pick up the box to complete the task, focusing on the most direct path to the box to save time. I would also avoid picking up unnecessary items, such as the purple key, to save time and reduce potential distractions.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid Agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box.

After obtaining the key, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will use the key to unlock the purple locked door if necessary and be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference. If I encounter any obstacles or dead ends, I will re-route my path and adjust my plan accordingly to ensure the successful completion of the task.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by turning right to face east and move forward to the space at (2, 1) to avoid agent1, then move forward again to the space at (3, 1) to pick up the purple key.
