The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

Initially, I would go right from the starting point to reach the wall at (10, x) and then move left along the wall to reach the x-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach (8, x), I would move up to reach the y-coordinate of the green box and pick it up. This approach would save time by avoiding unnecessary turns and movements. Additionally, I would avoid picking up the purple key unless necessary, as it was not required to complete the task in this scenario.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently.

You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I would start by moving towards the green box at (8, 1) in a more efficient manner. Initially, I would go right from the starting point to reach the wall at (10, x) and then move left along the wall to reach the x-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach (8, x), I would move up to reach the y-coordinate of the green box and pick it up. This approach would save time by avoiding unnecessary turns and movements. Additionally, I would avoid picking up the purple key unless necessary, as it was not required to complete the task in this scenario.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\n\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible",

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the strategy to complete the task, considering actions that are useful and those that should be improved.

     "To complete the task of picking up the box, I plan to start by moving east and then south to reach the purple open door at (5, 3), which could provide access to the green box at (8, 1). After passing through the door, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will avoid going west as it leads to a wall and is not necessary for the task. Additionally, I will try to find a way to use the yellow ball I picked up earlier to potentially unlock or access new areas.",

     "To complete the task, I would start by moving towards the green box at (8, 1) in a more efficient manner. Initially, I would go right from the starting point to reach the wall at (10, x) and then move left along the wall to reach the x-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach (8, x), I would move up to reach the y-coordinate of the green box and pick it up. This approach would save time by avoiding unnecessary turns and movements. Additionally, I would avoid picking up the purple key unless necessary, as it was not required to complete the task in this scenario.",
     "To accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.",
