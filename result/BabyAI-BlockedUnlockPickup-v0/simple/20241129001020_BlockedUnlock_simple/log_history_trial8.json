  "To complete the task of picking up the box, I plan to start by moving east and then south to reach the purple open door at (5, 3), but first, I will explore the area to find the purple key to unlock the door. After obtaining the key or finding an alternative way to open the door, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will use the yellow ball to unlock the purple locked door if necessary and be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference.
