    "I will start by turning left to face north and moving forward to the space at (6, 3), then move north to reach the space at (6, 2) to avoid agent1, and continue north to the space at (6, 1). Next, I will move east to reach the green box at (8, 1) and pick it up to complete the task. I will be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference and adjust my plan accordingly to ensure the successful completion of the task.",
    "I will start by turning right to face east and move forward to the space at (8, 1), but since there is a wall, I will drop the purple key in my current location to free my hand and then pick up the green box at (8, 1) in my forward coordinate to complete the task. Alternatively, I can turn left to face north and move forward to the space at (7, 0), then turn right to face east and move forward to the space at (8, 0), and finally turn right to face south and move forward to the space at (8, 1) to pick up the green box. I will prioritize the first plan to save time and avoid unnecessary movements.",
    "I will start by turning left to face west and moving forward to the space at (0, 1), then continue moving west to the space at (0, 0) and turn right to face south. Next, I will move south to the space at (0, 2) and turn right to face west, then move west to the space at (0, 3) and pick up the purple key. After obtaining the key, I will move east to the purple locked door at (5, 3) and use the key to unlock it, then move through the door to reach the green box at (8, 1) and pick it up to complete the task."

    "To accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid Agent0, then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box.
