I will use the key to unlock the purple locked door if necessary and be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference. If I encounter any obstacles or dead ends, I will re-route my path and adjust my plan accordingly to ensure the successful completion of the task.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by turning right to face east and move forward to the space at (2, 1) to avoid agent1, then move forward again to the space at (3, 1) to pick up the purple key.

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

Next, I will move forward to the space at (2, 2) to pick up the yellow ball and drop it to free up my hands. After that, I will move forward to the space at (3, 3) to pick up the purple key, then move back to the purple locked door at (5, 3) and use the key to unlock it.

After obtaining the key, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will use the key to unlock the purple locked door if necessary and be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference. If I encounter any obstacles or dead ends, I will re-route my path and adjust my plan accordingly to ensure the successful completion of the task.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by turning right to face east and move forward to the space at (2, 1) to avoid agent1, then move forward again to the space at (3, 1) to pick up the purple key.
