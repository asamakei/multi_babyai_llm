After passing through the door, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will then turn left to face the box and pick it up to complete the task.

Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach the correct position, I would pick up the green box to complete the task. Additionally, I would avoid picking up unnecessary items and focus on the most direct path to the green box to save time.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid Agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box. I would avoid picking up unnecessary items, such as the purple key, and focus on the most direct path to the green box to save time.
