The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'. Work with other agents to accomplish tasks.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the mission, I should first navigate to the location of the purple locked door at (5, 3) by moving right and then forward. Once I reach the door, I will use the purple key to open it, allowing Agent0 to proceed. After opening the door, I will move forward and check if the box is behind it, and if so, I will pick it up, completing the mission. I will also communicate with Agent0 to further explore the area and find the box if it's not behind the door. Additionally, I will make sure to execute the 'open the door' action correctly to avoid failure.\nTrial 1:\nI will start by moving forward to (4, 1), then turn right to face east, and then move forward to (5, 1), then move forward to (5, 2) to be in front of the purple locked door at (5, 3). Once I'm in position, I will use the 'open the door in forward' action to unlock the purple door using the purple key, allowing Agent0 to proceed. After opening the door, I will move forward and check if the box is behind it, and if so, I will pick it up, completing the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the mission, I will start by moving forward to (4, 1), then turn right to face south, then move forward to (4, 2), then turn right to face west, then move forward to (3, 2), then turn right to face north, then move forward to (3, 3) is not possible because there is wall at (3, 3), so I will move forward to (4, 3) is not possible because there is yellow ball at (4, 3), so I will turn left to face west, then move forward to (3, 2), then turn left to face south, then move forward to (3, 1), then turn right to face east, then move forward to (4, 1), then move forward to (5, 1), then move forward to (5, 2), then move forward to (5, 3) to be in front of the purple locked door at (5, 3).

Once I reach the door, I will use the purple key to open it, allowing Agent0 to proceed. After opening the door, I will move forward and check if the box is behind it, and if so, I will pick it up, completing the mission. I will also communicate with Agent0 to further explore the area and find the box if it's not behind the door.
