Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If it is concrete enough, the output may be taken from in your action names. Output very appropriate subgoal to achieve your task as soon as possible in a few words.\nYour subgoal:"

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 70:\nYou have yellow ball.

There is wall at (1, 5). There is purple key at (1, 1). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 5).

There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is purple key at (1, 1).

Your forward is coordinate (1, 1), which is north, there is purple key. Your right is cooridnate (2, 2), which is east, there is no object. Your left is coordinate (0, 2), which is west, there is wall.\nYou have yellow ball. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0).
