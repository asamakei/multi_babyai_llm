It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 70:\nYou have yellow ball. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (5, 2). There is purple locked door at (5, 3). There is wall at (5, 4).
