However, if I need to get to the box later, I will have to navigate towards it from there.\nYour action: pick up item that in the forward coordinate\nYou failed to picked up because there is no item in your forward coordinate.\ntime 3:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2).

Afterward, I will need to find a path to the box's location to complete my task.\n\nYou already achieved subgoals []. You think you should achieve subgoals ['pick up the ball', 'pick up the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'pick up the ball' for achieving pick up the key. Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'pick up the ball', output the action name as a subgoal.

Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'use yellow key on door at (5, 3)' for achieving open door at (5, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'use yellow key on door at (5, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal.

Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'use yellow key on door at (5, 3)' for achieving open door at (5, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'use yellow key on door at (5, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal.

After that, I will need to continue exploring the surrounding area to locate the box, as it is not currently visible.\nYour action: turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 51:\nYour position is coordinate (3, 3).

Your left is coordinate (3, 4), there is no object.\nYou think:To accomplish the task of picking up the box, I should first go to the forward coordinate (2, 3) and explore that area for any clues or items that may assist me. After ensuring that I have explored my current surroundings, I can rotate and navigate further to locate the box, since it is not currently visible. If needed, I can also consider backtracking to coordinate (4, 3) to potentially pick up the red ball if it becomes relevant for my exploration.\n\nYou already achieved subgoals ['pick up yellow key', 'pick up the key']. You think you should achieve subgoals ['use yellow key on door at (5, 3)', 'open door at (5, 3)', 'open door at (2, 4)', 'open door at (1, 4)', 'open door at (1, 3)', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'use yellow key on door at (5, 3)' for achieving open door at (5, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'use yellow key on door at (5, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:"
