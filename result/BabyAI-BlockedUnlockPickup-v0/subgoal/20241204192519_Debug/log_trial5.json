Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'go to (4, 3)'. Don't output same meaning subgoal and don't use relative expressions and time-dependent expressions for agent. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If it is concrete enough, the output may be taken from in your action names. Output very appropriate subgoal to achieve your task as soon as possible in a few words.\nYour subgoal:"
