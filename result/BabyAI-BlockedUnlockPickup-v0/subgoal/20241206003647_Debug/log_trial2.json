It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Your mission is 'pick up the box'. You are red triangle. Each step, you can act in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'. Output subgoal list to achieve your task in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', ... 'pick up the box']. Output list of abstract subgoals with enough length, without action name so much appropriately. The last subgoal of the list is your mission. Output only result.\nsubgoal list:"
