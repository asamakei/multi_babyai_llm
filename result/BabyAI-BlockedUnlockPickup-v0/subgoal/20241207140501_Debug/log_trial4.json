The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 22:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2).

There is purple locked door at (5, 3). There is wall at (5, 4). There is wall at (5, 5). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall in your forward coordinate (5, 2). There is yellow ball in your right coordinate (4, 3). There is no object in your left coordinate (4, 1).\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 23:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2).

There is no object in your right coordinate (3, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (5, 2).\nYour think:I should go to the yellow ball, then turn left to face north and go north to reach the box is incorrect because there is a wall at (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5). I will go to the yellow ball, then turn left to face north and go north to reach the wall, then turn left to face west and go west to reach the box.\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 26:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2).

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 30:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2). Your forward is (3, 2), west. Your right is (4, 1), north. Your left is (4, 3), south. You have purple key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 5). There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (0, 3). There is wall at (0, 2). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall at (4, 0). There is no object in your forward coordinate (3, 2). There is no object in your right coordinate (4, 1). There is yellow ball in your left coordinate (4, 3).\nYour action: drop carrying item to the forward coordinate\nYou dropped purple key.\ntime 31:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2). Your forward is (3, 2), west. Your right is (4, 1), north. Your left is (4, 3), south. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 5). There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (0, 3). There is wall at (0, 2). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall at (4, 0). There is purple key in your forward coordinate (3, 2). There is no object in your right coordinate (4, 1). There is yellow ball in your left coordinate (4, 3).\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 32:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2). Your forward is (4, 3), south. Your right is (3, 2), west. Your left is (5, 2), east. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 5). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (5, 4). There is purple locked door at (5, 3). There is yellow ball in your forward coordinate (4, 3). There is purple key in your right coordinate (3, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (5, 2).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 33:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2). Your forward is (4, 3), south. Your right is (3, 2), west. Your left is (5, 2), east. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 5). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (5, 4). There is purple locked door at (5, 3). There is yellow ball in your forward coordinate (4, 3). There is purple key in your right coordinate (3, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (5, 2).\nYour think:I should go to the right coordinate to obtain the purple key, then go to the forward coordinate to pick up the yellow ball is not correct because there is no available space to put the yellow ball. Instead, I should go to the right coordinate to obtain the purple key, then go to the left coordinate to reach the purple locked door, unlock the door, and finally pick up the box.\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 34:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2). Your forward is (4, 3), south. Your right is (3, 2), west. Your left is (5, 2), east. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 5). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (5, 4). There is purple locked door at (5, 3). There is yellow ball in your forward coordinate (4, 3). There is purple key in your right coordinate (3, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (5, 2).\n\nIn previous steps, you achieved subgoals ['go south', 'go east', 'go to right coordinate', 'go north', 'go to left coordinate', 'go to purple key', 'obtain the key', 'go east', 'go to coordinate (4,2)', 'go right', 'go to yellow ball', 'go to yellow ball', 'drop purple key at (3, 2)', 'drop purple key'] in order. You think you should achieve subgoals ['go to purple key', 'go to right coordinate', 'go to coordinate (5,2)', 'go east', 'go to purple locked door', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box']. Output abstract plan, what you think would accomplish the task in the current situation in 2 to 3 sentences.\nYour think:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo accomplish the task, I should go to the right coordinate to obtain the purple key, then go to the left coordinate to reach the purple locked door, unlock the door, and finally pick up the box."

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 59:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2).
