The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 63:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 4).

I will go forward to pick up the yellow ball, then go right to the purple door, drop the yellow ball, go to the box, and then pick up the box.\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 67:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 4).
