     "You interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. Grid size is 11 x 6. Position is represented by (Column, Row). The top-left most square is (0, 0). There is grey box at (8, 1). There is yellow key at (1, 3). There is blue ball at (4, 4). There is yellow locked door at (5, 4). It is not possible to overlap objects. Your mission is 'pick up the box'. You are red triangle. Each step, you can act in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'. Output subgoal list to achieve your task in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', ...]. Output abstract but detail subgoals list. The last subgoal of the list is your mission.
