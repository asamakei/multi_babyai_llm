There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall in your forward coordinate (2, 0). There is no object in your right coordinate (3, 1). There is purple key in your left coordinate (1, 1).\nYour think:To accomplish the task, I should go to the forward coordinate (2, 0) is not possible because there is a wall in the forward coordinate, so I should go to the right coordinate (3, 1), then continue going east to reach the box location (5, 1), and pick up the box.\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\n\nIn the previous step, you thought you should achieve ['go to coordinate (5, 1)', 'pick up the box']. Is the subgoal 'go to coordinate (5, 1)' achieved? Output only 'Yes' or 'No'.\nYes or No:"
