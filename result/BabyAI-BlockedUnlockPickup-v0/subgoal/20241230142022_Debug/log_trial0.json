Your left is coordinate (5, 3), there is yellow locked door.\nYou think:To accomplish the task of picking up the box, I will first move forward to (4, 4) to drop the red ball. After dropping the ball, I will then turn left to face east and proceed to (4, 2) to pick up the yellow key, allowing me to unlock the yellow door at (5, 3) and access the box. Finally, I will return to (5, 3) to pick up the box.\n\nYou already achieved subgoals ['pick up the ball']. You think you should achieve subgoals ['drop red ball to (4, 3)', 'go to (1, 3)', 'pick up the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'drop red ball to (4, 3)' for achieving go to (1, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'drop red ball to (4, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:"

From there, I will assess my options and decide whether to proceed further towards the box or explore the surrounding coordinates for any needed actions, such as unlocking doors or avoiding walls, while ensuring I don't pick up any items unless I have none.\n\nYou already achieved subgoals ['pick up the ball', 'drop red ball to (4, 3)', 'go to (4, 1)', 'go to (1, 1)', 'go to (1, 3)', 'pick up the key']. You think you should achieve subgoals ['use yellow key at (5, 3)', 'unlock door at (5, 3) using yellow key', 'open door at (5, 3)', 'open door at (1, 5)', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'use yellow key at (5, 3)' for achieving unlock door at (5, 3) using yellow key. Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'use yellow key at (5, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal.
