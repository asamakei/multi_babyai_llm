Once I have the key, I will then explore potential paths to locate the box and utilize the key to unlock any doors that may obstruct my access to it.\n\nYou already achieved subgoals ['pick up the ball', 'pick up the key']. You think you should achieve subgoals ['open door at (1, 4)', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'open door at (1, 4)' for achieving unlock the door. Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'open door at (1, 4)', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:",
      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast.
