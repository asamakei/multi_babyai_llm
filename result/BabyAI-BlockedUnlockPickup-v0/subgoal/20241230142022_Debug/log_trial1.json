Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'drop red ball to forward coordinate' for achieving drop red ball to (4, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'drop red ball to forward coordinate', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:"

Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'drop red ball to forward coordinate' for achieving drop red ball to (4, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'drop red ball to forward coordinate', output the action name as a subgoal.

Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'drop red ball to forward coordinate' for achieving drop red ball to (4, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'drop red ball to forward coordinate', output the action name as a subgoal.

Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'drop red ball to forward coordinate', output the action name as a subgoal.

You think you should achieve subgoals ['go to (4, 3)', 'drop carrying item to (4, 3)', 'drop red ball to forward coordinate', 'drop red ball to (4, 3)', 'go to (1, 3)', 'pick up the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'go to (4, 3)' for achieving drop carrying item to (4, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to (4, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:"

You think you should achieve subgoals ['go to (3, 1)', 'go to (4, 3)', 'drop carrying item to (4, 3)', 'drop red ball to forward coordinate', 'drop red ball to (4, 3)', 'go to (1, 3)', 'pick up the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'go to (3, 1)' for achieving go to (4, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to (3, 1)', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:"

Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'go to (4, 3)' for achieving drop carrying item to (4, 3). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to (4, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal.

You think you should achieve subgoals ['drop carrying item to (4, 3)', 'drop red ball to forward coordinate', 'drop red ball to (4, 3)', 'go to (1, 3)', 'pick up the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'drop carrying item to (4, 3)' for achieving drop red ball to forward coordinate. Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'drop carrying item to (4, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal.

After obtaining the key, I will unlock the yellow door at (5, 3) to access the box.\n\nYou already achieved subgoals ['pick up the ball', 'go to (3, 1)', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to left coordinate', 'go to (3, 2)']. You think you should achieve subgoals ['drop carrying item to (4, 3)', 'drop red ball to forward coordinate', 'drop red ball to (4, 3)', 'go to (1, 3)', 'pick up the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'drop carrying item to (4, 3)' for achieving drop red ball to forward coordinate. Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'drop carrying item to (4, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:"
