Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 70:\nYour position is coordinate (9, 1). Your forward is (9, 0), north. Your right is (10, 1), east. Your left is (8, 1), west. You have purple key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (6, 0). There is wall at (7, 0).

There is wall at (10, 4). There is wall in your forward coordinate (10, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (9, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (9, 0).\nYour think:I should go to the left coordinate (8, 1) to pick up the green box.
