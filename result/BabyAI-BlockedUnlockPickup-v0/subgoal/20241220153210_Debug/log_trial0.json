Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If it is concrete enough, the output may be taken from in your action names. Output very appropriate subgoal to achieve your task as soon as possible in a few words.\nYour subgoal:"

Your left is coordinate (3, 0), there is wall.\n\nOutput abstract plan, what you think would accomplish the task in the current situation in 2 to 3 sentences.\nYour think:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI would go to the forward coordinate to move to (4, 1), then pick up the blue ball is not my task, so I would go to the forward coordinate to move to (5, 1), then go to the right coordinate to move to (5, 2), then go to the right coordinate to move to (5, 3), then go to the left coordinate to move to (4, 3), then pick up the blue ball is not my task, so I would go to the left coordinate to move to (3, 3), then go to the left coordinate to move to (2, 3), then go to the left coordinate to move to (1, 3), then go to the left coordinate to move to (0, 3), then go to the left coordinate to move to (-1, 3) is not valid, so I would go to the left coordinate to move to (1, 2), then go to the right coordinate to move to (1, 3), then go to the right coordinate to move to (1, 4), then go to the right coordinate to move to (1, 5), then go to the right coordinate to move to (0, "
