The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 25:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 2). Your forward is (1, 1), north. Your right is (2, 2), east. Your left is (0, 2), west. You have yellow ball. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is purple key in your forward coordinate (1, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (2, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (0, 2).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 26:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 2). Your forward is (1, 1), north. Your right is (2, 2), east. Your left is (0, 2), west. You have yellow ball. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is purple key in your forward coordinate (1, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (2, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (0, 2).\nYour action: pick up item that in the forward coordinate\nYou failed to picked up because you already have other item.\ntime 27:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 2). Your forward is (1, 1), north. Your right is (2, 2), east. Your left is (0, 2), west. You have yellow ball. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is purple key in your forward coordinate (1, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (2, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (0, 2).\nYour action: drop carrying item to the forward coordinate\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 28:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 2). Your forward is (1, 1), north. Your right is (2, 2), east. Your left is (0, 2), west. You have yellow ball. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is purple key in your forward coordinate (1, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (2, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (0, 2).\nYour think:To achieve the subgoal 'go to coordinate (1, 1)', I think I should turn left first, then go to the forward coordinate (1, 2) is not possible because there is a wall in the forward coordinate (1, 1).\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 29:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 2). Your forward is (0, 2), west. Your right is (1, 1), north. Your left is (1, 3), south. You have yellow ball. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 5). There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (0, 3). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall in your forward coordinate (0, 2). There is purple key in your right coordinate (1, 1). There is no object in your left coordinate (1, 3).\n\nYou are agent0. In previous steps, you achieved subgoals ['go to (4, 4)', 'go to left coordinate', 'go to (4, 4)', 'go to yellow ball', 'go to (4, 3)', 'move to (4, 3)', 'pick up yellow ball', 'get the ball out of the way', 'go to left coordinate', 'go to coordinate (3, 4)', 'go to coordinate (3, 4)', 'go to coordinate (3, 3)', 'go to coordinate (3, 3)', 'go to coordinate (2, 3)', 'go to left coordinate (2, 3)', 'go to (2, 3)', 'go to coordinate (2, 3)', 'go to coordinate (1, 3)', 'go to coordinate (1, 1)', 'go to purple key', 'go to coordinate (1, 1)', 'go to forward coordinate (1, 1)', 'drop yellow ball in coordinate (1, 3)', 'drop yellow ball at (1, 3)', 'drop yellow ball at (1, 2)', 'drop yellow ball', 'pick up purple key', 'obtain the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. You think you should achieve subgoals ['go to coordinate (1, 1)', 'go to forward coordinate (1, 1)', 'drop yellow ball in coordinate (1, 3)', 'drop yellow ball at (1, 3)', 'drop yellow ball at (1, 2)', 'drop yellow ball', 'pick up purple key', 'obtain the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output plan, what you think would achieve the subgoals, especially go to coordinate (1, 1), in the current situation in 2 to 3 sentences.\nYour think:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo achieve the subgoal 'go to coordinate (1, 1)', I think I should turn right first, then go to the forward coordinate."
