There is yellow ball in your forward coordinate (4, 3). There is wall in your right coordinate (5, 4). There is no object in your left coordinate (3, 4).\n\nYou are agent0. You think you should achieve subgoals ['go to coordinate (3, 3)', 'go to coordinate (2, 4)', 'go to coordinate (2, 3)', 'go to coordinate (2, 2)', 'go to coordinate (2, 1)', 'go to coordinate (1, 1)', 'go to key', 'get the ball out of the way', 'obtain the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box']. Output abstract plan, what you think would achieve the subgoals, especially 'go to coordinate (3, 3)' for achieving 'go to coordinate (2, 4)', in the current situation in 2 to 3 sentences, briefly.\nYour think:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo achieve 'go to coordinate (3, 3)', I plan to turn right and go to the forward coordinate. Then, I will turn left and go to the forward coordinate, which will allow me to reach (3, 3)."
