There is blue ball at (4, 3).\nYour forward is coordinate (3, 1), there is no object. Your right is cooridnate (4, 0), there is wall. Your left is coordinate (4, 2), there is no object.\nYou think:To achieve the subgoal 'pick up red key', I think I should go to the right coordinate (3, 2) where the red key is. Then, I can pick up the red key and then go to (4, 2) to achieve the next subgoal 'go to (4, 2)'.\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\n\nIn the previous step, you thought you should achieve ['go to the box', 'pick up the box']. Is the subgoal 'go to the box' achieved? Output only 'Yes' or 'No'. Note that for subgoal such as 'go to A', you should output 'Yes' when your forward is coordinate A or there is A in your forward coordinate.\nYes or No:"
