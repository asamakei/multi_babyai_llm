The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 1:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 4). You are facing north You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is red key at (3, 2). There is wall at (5, 2). There is red locked door at (5, 3).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 2:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 4).

There is red locked door at (5, 3).\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 3:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 4). You are facing west You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 5). There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (0, 3). There is wall at (0, 2). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (1, 5).

You are facing west You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 5). There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (0, 3). There is wall at (0, 2). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (2, 5). There is red key at (3, 2).\nYou think:To achieve 'go to (4, 3)' for 'go to blue ball', I think I should 'turn right' to face north and 'go to the forward coordinate' to move to (4, 3) where the blue ball is located, but since there is no blue ball in this problem, I will 'go to (3, 3)' and 'turn right' and 'go to the forward coordinate' to move to (4, 3) where the box is located.\nYour action: turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 5:\nYour position is coordinate (3, 4).

There is wall at (0, 3). There is blue ball at (4, 3). There is red locked door at (5, 3). There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (5, 4).\nYour forward is coordinate (3, 3), there is no object. Your right is cooridnate (4, 4), there is no object. Your left is coordinate (2, 4), there is no object.\n\nYou think you should achieve subgoals ['go to (3, 3)', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to blue ball', 'pick up blue ball', 'go to forward coordinate to pick up blue ball', 'pick up the ball', 'go to coordinate (3, 4)', 'go to (3, 2)', 'drop blue ball at (1, 1)', 'go to coordinate (1, 2)', 'go to coordinate (2, 4)', 'go to (2, 4)', 'go to coordinate (1, 3)', 'go to (1, 3)', 'drop blue ball at (2, 3)', 'drop blue ball', 'go to coordinate (3, 4)', 'go to coordinate (3, 3)', 'go to (3, 2)', 'pick up the key', 'go to (4, 2)', 'go to (4, 2), then go to (5, 2), then go to (5, 3)', 'go to coordinate (3, 3)', 'go to (3, 3)', 'go to coordinate (2, 3)', 'go to (1, 2)', 'go to (1, 1)', 'go to (2, 1)', 'go to (2, 2)', 'go to (3, 2)', 'go to (3, 3)', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to (5, 3)', 'open door at (5, 3)', 'unlock the door', 'go to the box', 'pick up the box'].
