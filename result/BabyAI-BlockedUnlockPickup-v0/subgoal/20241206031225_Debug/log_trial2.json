The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 14:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2). Your forward is (4, 3), south. Your right is (3, 2), west. Your left is (5, 2), east. You have purple key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 5). There is wall at (4, 5).

There is yellow ball in your right coordinate (4, 3). There is no object in your left coordinate (4, 1).\nYour action: drop carrying item to the forward coordinate\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 16:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 2). Your forward is (5, 2), east. Your right is (4, 3), south. Your left is (4, 1), north. You have purple key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 1).

I will go to the coordinate (4, 1), then go to the coordinate (3, 2), then go to the coordinate (3, 3), then go to the coordinate (4, 3), then pick up the box is not the correct solution because you already have an item.
