There is wall at (0, 3). There is wall at (0, 2). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 5). There is purple key at (1, 1). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (3, 0). There is no object in your forward coordinate (2, 3). There is no object in your right coordinate (3, 2). There is no object in your left coordinate (3, 4).\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 1:\nYour position is coordinate (3, 3). Your forward is (3, 4), south. Your right is (2, 3), west. Your left is (4, 3), east. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 5). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (0, 5). There is wall at (5, 4). There is wall at (0, 4). There is purple locked door at (5, 3). There is wall at (0, 3). There is no object in your forward coordinate (3, 4). There is no object in your right coordinate (2, 3). There is yellow ball in your left coordinate (4, 3).\nYour think:I will go to the coordinate of the box, move the ball out of the way, obtain the key, unlock the door, and then pick up the box.\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 2:\nYour position is coordinate (3, 3). Your forward is (4, 3), east. Your right is (3, 4), south. Your left is (3, 2), north. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (5, 2). There is purple locked door at (5, 3). There is wall at (5, 4). There is wall at (5, 5). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (3, 5). There is yellow ball in your forward coordinate (4, 3). There is no object in your right coordinate (3, 4). There is no object in your left coordinate (3, 2).\n\nYou are agent0. In previous steps, you achieved subgoals ['go to coordinate (4, 3)', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to box', 'get the ball out of the way', 'obtain the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. You think you should achieve subgoals ['go to box', 'get the ball out of the way', 'obtain the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box']. Output abstract plan, what you think would accomplish the task in the current situation in 2 to 3 sentences.\nYour think:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo accomplish the task, I should move the yellow ball out of the way, then go to the coordinate of the purple key, obtain the key, unlock the purple locked door, and finally go to the box and pick it up."
