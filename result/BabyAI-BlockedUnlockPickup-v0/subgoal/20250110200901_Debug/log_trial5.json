Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to left coordinate', output the action name as a subgoal.

Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to forward 3 times', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:"

Your left is coordinate (4, 3), there is red ball.\nYou think:To accomplish the task, I will move forward to the left coordinate until I find the box.\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\n\nIn the previous step, you thought you should achieve ['unlock the door', 'pick up the box']. Is the subgoal 'unlock the door' achieved? Output only 'Yes' or 'No'. Note that for subgoal such as 'go to A', you should output 'Yes' when your forward is coordinate A or there is A in your forward coordinate.\nYes or No:"
