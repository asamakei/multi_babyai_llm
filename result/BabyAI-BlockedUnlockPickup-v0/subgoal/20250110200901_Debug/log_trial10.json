Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to (1, 2)', output the action name as a subgoal.

You think you should achieve subgoals ['pick up the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'pick up the key' for achieving unlock the door. Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'pick up the key', output the action name as a subgoal.

You think you should achieve subgoals ['go to (1, 3)', 'pick up the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'go to (1, 3)' for achieving pick up the key. Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to (1, 3)', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:"

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 68:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 4). You are facing north You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (0, 2). There is wall at (0, 3). There is red ball at (4, 3).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 69:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 3). You are facing north You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (0, 2). There is red ball at (4, 3).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 70:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 2). You are facing north You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 71:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 1). You are facing north You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0).\nYour action: turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 72:\nYour position is coordinate (1, 1). You are facing east You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (5, 2). There is yellow locked door at (5, 3). There is wall at (5, 4). There is wall at (4, 0). There is red ball at (4, 3). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (2, 0).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 73:\nYour position is coordinate (2, 1). You are facing east You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (5, 2). There is yellow locked door at (5, 3). There is wall at (5, 4). There is wall at (4, 0). There is red ball at (4, 3). There is wall at (3, 0).\nYou think:I will continue moving forward to explore the space and search for the box. I will keep going east until I find the box or reach an obstacle that requires me to change direction.\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 74:\nYour position is coordinate (3, 1). You are facing east You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (5, 2). There is yellow locked door at (5, 3). There is wall at (5, 4). There is wall at (4, 0). There is red ball at (4, 3).\nYour forward is coordinate (4, 1), there is no object. Your right is cooridnate (3, 2), there is no object. Your left is coordinate (3, 0), there is wall.\nYou think:I will continue moving forward to explore the space and search for the box. Since there is no object at my forward coordinate (4, 1), I will go there next.\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\n\nIn the previous step, you thought you should achieve ['unlock the door', 'pick up the box']. Is the subgoal 'unlock the door' achieved? Output only 'Yes' or 'No'. Note that for subgoal such as 'go to A', you should output 'Yes' when your forward is coordinate A or there is A in your forward coordinate.\nYes or No:"
