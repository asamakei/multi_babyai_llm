You think you should achieve subgoals ['go to (2, 1)', 'go to (2, 4)', 'pick up the key', 'unlock the door', 'pick up the box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'go to (2, 1)' for achieving go to (2, 4). Don't output same meaning subgoal and subgoal that is not able to be achieved. Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to (2, 1)', output the action name as a subgoal. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words, only one subgoal.\nYour subgoal:"

There is wall at (2, 0).\nYour forward is coordinate (1, 2), there is no object. Your right is cooridnate (2, 1), there is no object. Your left is coordinate (2, 3), there is no object.\nYou think:I will move left to explore the area on the left until I find the box. I will keep moving left until I find the box, then pick it up to accomplish the task.\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\n\nIn the previous step, you thought you should achieve ['unlock the door', 'pick up the box']. Is the subgoal 'unlock the door' achieved? Output only 'Yes' or 'No'. Note that for subgoal such as 'go to A', you should output 'Yes' when your forward is coordinate A or there is A in your forward coordinate.\nYes or No:"
