If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'pick up yellow key at forward coordinate', output the action name as a subgoal.

Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to right coordinate', output the action name as a subgoal.

There is wall at (3, 0).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 72:\nYour position is coordinate (3, 1). You are facing east You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (5, 2). There is yellow locked door at (5, 3). There is wall at (5, 4). There is wall at (4, 0). There is red ball at (4, 3).\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 73:\nYour position is coordinate (3, 1). You are facing north You have yellow key.

There is wall at (5, 1).\nYou think:I will move right to coordinate (4, 1) and continue exploring the area to locate the box. Once I find the box, I will pick it up to accomplish the task.\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 74:\nYour position is coordinate (3, 1). You are facing west You have yellow key.

There is wall at (2, 0).\nYour forward is coordinate (2, 1), there is no object. Your right is cooridnate (3, 0), there is wall. Your left is coordinate (3, 2), there is no object.\nYou think:I will move forward to coordinate (2, 1) and then turn right to face north, then move forward to explore the area and locate the box. Once I find the box, I will pick it up to accomplish the task.\nYour action: turn right\nYou turned right.\n\nIn the previous step, you thought you should achieve ['unlock the door', 'pick up the box']. Is the subgoal 'unlock the door' achieved? Output only 'Yes' or 'No'. Note that for subgoal such as 'go to A', you should output 'Yes' when your forward is coordinate A or there is A in your forward coordinate.\nYes or No:"
