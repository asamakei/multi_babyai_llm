Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to (4, 2)', output the action name as a subgoal.

Don't use relative expressions for example, 'move right', 'move east', 'go to left'. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If any of your actions 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate', 'open the door at the forward coordinate' can achieve 'go to (2, 1)', output the action name as a subgoal.
