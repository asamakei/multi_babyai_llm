By dropping the key, I can avoid the mistake of trying to pick up the box while already holding an item.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should start by turning right to face east, then move forward to (5, 2), and open the blue door at (5, 3) to create a new path.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the mission, I would first drop the blue key to free up my hands, then move east towards the yellow box, and finally pick up the box to complete the task. This plan ensures that I have a clear path to the box and can pick it up without any obstacles. I would avoid unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas, and focus solely on reaching the box. By dropping the key, I can avoid the mistake of trying to pick up the box while already holding an item.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should start by turning right to face east, then move forward to (5, 2), and open the blue door at (5, 3) to create a new path. After that, I should move forward to (5, 3), then turn left to face north, and move forward to (5, 4), then turn right to face east and move forward to (6, 4), and finally move forward to (7, 4) and then (8, 4) to pick up the yellow box.\n\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 12:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the mission, I would first drop the blue key to free up my hands, then move east towards the yellow box, and finally pick up the box to complete the task. This plan ensures that I have a clear path to the box and can pick it up without any obstacles. I would avoid unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas, and focus solely on reaching the box. By dropping the key, I can avoid the mistake of trying to pick up the box while already holding an item.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should start by turning right to face east, then move forward to (5, 2), and open the blue door at (5, 3) to create a new path.

This plan ensures that I have a clear path to the box and can pick it up without any obstacles. I would avoid unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas, and focus solely on reaching the box. By dropping the key, I can avoid the mistake of trying to pick up the box while already holding an item.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should start by turning right to face east, then move forward to (5, 2), and open the blue door at (5, 3) to create a new path. After that, I should move forward to (5, 3), then turn left to face north, and move forward to (5, 4), then turn right to face east and move forward to (6, 4), and finally move forward to (7, 4) and then (8, 4) to pick up the yellow box.\n\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible",

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the mission, I would first drop the blue key to free up my hands, then move east towards the yellow box, and finally pick up the box to complete the task. This plan ensures that I have a clear path to the box and can pick it up without any obstacles. I would avoid unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas, and focus solely on reaching the box. By dropping the key, I can avoid the mistake of trying to pick up the box while already holding an item.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should start by turning right to face east, then move forward to (5, 2), and open the blue door at (5, 3) to create a new path.
