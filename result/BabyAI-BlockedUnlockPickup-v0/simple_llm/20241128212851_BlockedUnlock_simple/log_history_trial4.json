  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To accomplish the mission, I would first drop the blue key to free up my hands, then move east towards the yellow box, and finally pick up the box to complete the task. This plan ensures that I have a clear path to the box and can pick it up without any obstacles. I would avoid unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas, and focus solely on reaching the box. By dropping the key, I can avoid the mistake of trying to pick up the box while already holding an item.",
