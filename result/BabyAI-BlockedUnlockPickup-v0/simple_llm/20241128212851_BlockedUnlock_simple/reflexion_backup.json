    "To accomplish the mission, I would start by dropping the grey ball to free up my hands, then move forward to (3, 2) and explore the area to try to find the blue key, which I can use to unlock the blue locked door at (5, 3) and access the area behind it, which may lead me to the box. I would then use the key to unlock the door and move forward to find the box, avoiding unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas. Next, I would move east towards the yellow box and pick it up to complete the task.",
    "To accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should first turn left to face west, then move forward to (1, 2) to avoid the wall in front of me. Next, I should drop the blue key to free up my hands, then continue moving forward to reach the box. After that, I should navigate through the environment, avoiding walls and other obstacles, until I reach the box. Finally, I should pick up the box to complete the task.",
    "To accomplish the mission, I should first drop the blue key to free up my hands. Then, I should turn left to face north and move forward to a safe location to drop the key. After that, I should turn right to face east and move forward to (8, 4) to pick up the yellow box. By dropping the key, I can avoid the mistake of trying to pick up the box while already holding an item. This plan ensures that I have a clear path to the box and can pick it up without any obstacles."

This plan should allow me to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time."
