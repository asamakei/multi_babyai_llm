The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should start by turning right to face east, then move forward to (5, 2), and open the blue door at (5, 3) to create a new path. After that, I should move forward to (5, 3), then turn left to face north, and move forward to (5, 4), then turn right to face east and move forward to (6, 4), and finally move forward to (7, 4) and then (8, 4) to pick up the yellow box.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the mission, I would start by dropping the grey ball to free up my hands, then move forward to (3, 2) and explore the area to try to find the blue key, which I can use to unlock the blue locked door at (5, 3) and access the area behind it, which may lead me to the box. I would then use the key to unlock the door and move forward to find the box, avoiding unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas. Next, I would move east towards the yellow box and pick it up to complete the task.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should first turn left to face west, then move forward to (1, 2) to avoid the wall in front of me. Next, I should drop the blue key to free up my hands, then continue moving forward to reach the box. After that, I should navigate through the environment, avoiding walls and other obstacles, until I reach the box.

By dropping the key, I can avoid the mistake of trying to pick up the box while already holding an item.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should start by turning right to face east, then move forward to (5, 2), and open the blue door at (5, 3) to create a new path. After that, I should move forward to (5, 3), then turn left to face north, and move forward to (5, 4), then turn right to face east and move forward to (6, 4), and finally move forward to (7, 4) and then (8, 4) to pick up the yellow box.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the mission, I would start by dropping the grey ball to free up my hands, then move forward to (3, 2) and explore the area to try to find the blue key, which I can use to unlock the blue locked door at (5, 3) and access the area behind it, which may lead me to the box. I would then use the key to unlock the door and move forward to find the box, avoiding unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas. Next, I would move east towards the yellow box and pick it up to complete the task.\nTrial 3:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should first turn left to face west, then move forward to (1, 2) to avoid the wall in front of me.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the mission, I would first drop the blue key to free up my hands, then move east towards the yellow box, and finally pick up the box to complete the task. This plan ensures that I have a clear path to the box and can pick it up without any obstacles. I would avoid unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas, and focus solely on reaching the box. By dropping the key, I can avoid the mistake of trying to pick up the box while already holding an item.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should start by turning right to face east, then move forward to (5, 2), and open the blue door at (5, 3) to create a new path. After that, I should move forward to (5, 3), then turn left to face north, and move forward to (5, 4), then turn right to face east and move forward to (6, 4), and finally move forward to (7, 4) and then (8, 4) to pick up the yellow box.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the mission, I would start by dropping the grey ball to free up my hands, then move forward to (3, 2) and explore the area to try to find the blue key, which I can use to unlock the blue locked door at (5, 3) and access the area behind it, which may lead me to the box. I would then use the key to unlock the door and move forward to find the box, avoiding unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas. Next, I would move east towards the yellow box and pick it up to complete the task.\nTrial 3:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should first turn left to face west, then move forward to (1, 2) to avoid the wall in front of me. Next, I should drop the blue key to free up my hands, then continue moving forward to reach the box.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should start by turning right to face east, then move forward to (5, 2), and open the blue door at (5, 3) to create a new path. After that, I should move forward to (5, 3), then turn left to face north, and move forward to (5, 4), then turn right to face east and move forward to (6, 4), and finally move forward to (7, 4) and then (8, 4) to pick up the yellow box.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the mission, I would start by dropping the grey ball to free up my hands, then move forward to (3, 2) and explore the area to try to find the blue key, which I can use to unlock the blue locked door at (5, 3) and access the area behind it, which may lead me to the box. I would then use the key to unlock the door and move forward to find the box, avoiding unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas. Next, I would move east towards the yellow box and pick it up to complete the task.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should first turn left to face west, then move forward to (1, 2) to avoid the wall in front of me.

I would then use the key to unlock the door and move forward to find the box, avoiding unnecessary actions such as turning or exploring other areas. Next, I would move east towards the yellow box and pick it up to complete the task.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the mission of picking up the box, I should first turn left to face west, then move forward to (1, 2) to avoid the wall in front of me. Next, I should drop the blue key to free up my hands, then continue moving forward to reach the box.
