  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To complete the task of picking up the box, I plan to start by moving east and then south to reach the purple open door at (5, 3), which could provide access to the green box at (8, 1). After passing through the door, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will avoid going west as it leads to a wall and is not necessary for the task. Additionally, I will try to find a way to use the yellow ball I picked up earlier to potentially unlock or access new areas.
