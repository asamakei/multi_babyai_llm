Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach the correct position, I would pick up the green box to complete the task. Additionally, I would avoid picking up unnecessary items and focus on the most direct path to the green box to save time.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid Agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1).

Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach the correct position, I would pick up the green box to complete the task. Additionally, I would avoid picking up unnecessary items and focus on the most direct path to the green box to save time.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid Agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1).

Additionally, I will try to find a way to use the yellow ball I picked up earlier to potentially unlock or access new areas. I will also drop any unnecessary items, such as the purple key, to free up my hands and allow me to pick up the box.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I plan to start by moving east and then south to reach the purple open door at (5, 3). After passing through the door, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will then turn left to face the box and pick it up to complete the task. I will also be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference. Additionally, I will avoid going west as it leads to a wall and is not necessary for the task.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I plan to start by moving east and then south to reach the purple open door at (5, 3), which could provide access to the green box at (8, 1). I will then pick up the yellow ball at (4, 4) and use it to unlock the purple locked door. After passing through the door, I will move east and then north to reach the box, turning left to face it before picking it up. I will also avoid going west as it leads to a wall and is not necessary for the task. Additionally, I will be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference.\n\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible",

Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach the correct position, I would pick up the green box to complete the task. Additionally, I would avoid picking up unnecessary items and focus on the most direct path to the green box to save time.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid Agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box. I would avoid picking up unnecessary items, such as the purple key, and focus on the most direct path to the green box to save time.

After passing through the door, I will move east and then north to reach the box. I will avoid going west as it leads to a wall and is not necessary for the task. Additionally, I will try to find a way to use the yellow ball I picked up earlier to potentially unlock or access new areas. I will also drop any unnecessary items, such as the purple key, to free up my hands and allow me to pick up the box.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I plan to start by moving east and then south to reach the purple open door at (5, 3).

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach the correct position, I would pick up the green box to complete the task. Additionally, I would avoid picking up unnecessary items and focus on the most direct path to the green box to save time.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid Agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1).
