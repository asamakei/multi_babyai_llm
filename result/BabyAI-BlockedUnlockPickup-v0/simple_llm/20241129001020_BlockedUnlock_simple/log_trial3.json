      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

Initially, I would go right from the starting point to reach the wall at (10, x) and then move left along the wall to reach the x-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach (8, x), I would move up to reach the y-coordinate of the green box and pick it up. This approach would save time by avoiding unnecessary turns and movements. Additionally, I would avoid picking up the purple key unless necessary, as it was not required to complete the task in this scenario.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1).

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I would start by moving towards the green box at (8, 1) in a more efficient manner. Initially, I would go right from the starting point to reach the wall at (10, x) and then move left along the wall to reach the x-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach (8, x), I would move up to reach the y-coordinate of the green box and pick it up. This approach would save time by avoiding unnecessary turns and movements. Additionally, I would avoid picking up the purple key unless necessary, as it was not required to complete the task in this scenario.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach the correct position, I would pick up the green box to complete the task. Additionally, I would avoid picking up unnecessary items and focus on the most direct path to the green box to save time.\n\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 16:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

Initially, I would go right from the starting point to reach the wall at (10, x) and then move left along the wall to reach the x-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach (8, x), I would move up to reach the y-coordinate of the green box and pick it up. This approach would save time by avoiding unnecessary turns and movements. Additionally, I would avoid picking up the purple key unless necessary, as it was not required to complete the task in this scenario.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box.

Initially, I would go right from the starting point to reach the wall at (10, x) and then move left along the wall to reach the x-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach (8, x), I would move up to reach the y-coordinate of the green box and pick it up. This approach would save time by avoiding unnecessary turns and movements. Additionally, I would avoid picking up the purple key unless necessary, as it was not required to complete the task in this scenario.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box.

Initially, I would go right from the starting point to reach the wall at (10, x) and then move left along the wall to reach the x-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach (8, x), I would move up to reach the y-coordinate of the green box and pick it up. This approach would save time by avoiding unnecessary turns and movements. Additionally, I would avoid picking up the purple key unless necessary, as it was not required to complete the task in this scenario.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving to the right and then forward to create some distance from the green box, allowing me to drop the yellow ball without obstruction. Then, I would drop the yellow ball and move forward to pick up the green box at (8, 1). This approach would free up my hands and enable me to pick up the green box efficiently. Additionally, I would avoid unnecessary turns and movements, and focus on the most direct path to the green box.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I would start by moving right from the initial position to avoid agent0 and then move forward to reach the x-coordinate of the green box at (8, 1). Next, I would move left to reach the x-coordinate of the green box and then move down to reach the y-coordinate of the green box. Once I reach the correct position, I would pick up the green box to complete the task. Additionally, I would avoid picking up unnecessary items and focus on the most direct path to the green box to save time.\n\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible",
