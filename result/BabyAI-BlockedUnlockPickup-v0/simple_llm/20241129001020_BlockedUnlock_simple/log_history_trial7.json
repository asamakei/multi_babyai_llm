  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To complete the task of picking up the box, I plan to start by moving east and then south to reach the purple open door at (5, 3), which could provide access to the green box at (8, 1). I will then pick up the yellow ball at (4, 4) and use it to unlock the purple locked door. After passing through the door, I will move east and then north to reach the box, turning left to face it before picking it up. I will also avoid going west as it leads to a wall and is not necessary for the task. Additionally, I will be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference.",

I will use the yellow ball to unlock the purple locked door if necessary and be cautious of agent1's movement in the area to prevent any potential interference.
