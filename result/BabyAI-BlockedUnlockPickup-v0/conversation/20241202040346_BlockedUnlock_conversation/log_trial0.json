What do you see, Agent1?\nagent1:I see a wall in front of me, a floor to my right, and a floor to my left. Since there's a wall in my forward direction, I'll turn left or right to move. I don't see the box either, but I can try to move and explore. Agent0, can you move forward and explore while I turn and try to find an opening?\nagent0:I'll move forward and explore. Since we don't know where the box is, let's try to cover more ground. I'll go forward and see what's ahead of me. If I find the box, I'll pick it up. If not, I'll report back to you and we can adjust our plan. Please turn left or right and explore your side, and let's meet back here if we don't find anything.\nagent1:I'll turn left and explore my side. I'll report back if I find the box or see anything interesting.

I also see you to my left, Agent0. I don't see the box yet, but I can try to move forward and explore my side. What's your plan, should we keep moving forward and meet at the wall, or should we try to cover the area in a different way?\nagent0:I think we should keep moving forward and meet at the wall.
