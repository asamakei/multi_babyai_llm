Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up. After obtaining the key, I will turn right to face the green locked door and open it. Then, I will move forward, turn left, and move forward to reach the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will move forward to the wall, turn left to face the purple box, and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up. After obtaining the key, I will turn right to face the green locked door and open it. Then, I will move forward, turn left, and move forward to reach the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will move forward to the wall, turn left to face the purple box, and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up.
