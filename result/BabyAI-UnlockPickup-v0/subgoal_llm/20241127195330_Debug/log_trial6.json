I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI plan to start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, but also keep an eye out for any paths that lead west, as my previous attempt got stuck in the west area. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area further to see if I can find any new paths or objects that can help me achieve the mission. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area again by setting a mental timer to limit my exploration time in that area. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission. By prioritizing the north and west areas and setting a mental timer, I hope to achieve the mission more efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, while also keeping an eye out for any paths that lead west. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI plan to start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, but also keep an eye out for any paths that lead west, as my previous attempt got stuck in the west area. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area further to see if I can find any new paths or objects that can help me achieve the mission. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area again by setting a mental timer to limit my exploration time in that area. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission. By prioritizing the north and west areas and setting a mental timer, I hope to achieve the mission more efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, while also keeping an eye out for any paths that lead west. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI plan to start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, but also keep an eye out for any paths that lead west, as my previous attempt got stuck in the west area. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area further to see if I can find any new paths or objects that can help me achieve the mission. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area again by setting a mental timer to limit my exploration time in that area. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission. By prioritizing the north and west areas and setting a mental timer, I hope to achieve the mission more efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, while also keeping an eye out for any paths that lead west. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box.

You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI plan to start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, but also keep an eye out for any paths that lead west, as my previous attempt got stuck in the west area. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area further to see if I can find any new paths or objects that can help me achieve the mission. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area again by setting a mental timer to limit my exploration time in that area. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission. By prioritizing the north and west areas and setting a mental timer, I hope to achieve the mission more efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, while also keeping an eye out for any paths that lead west. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion.

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI plan to start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, but also keep an eye out for any paths that lead west, as my previous attempt got stuck in the west area. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area further to see if I can find any new paths or objects that can help me achieve the mission. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area again by setting a mental timer to limit my exploration time in that area. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission. By prioritizing the north and west areas and setting a mental timer, I hope to achieve the mission more efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, while also keeping an eye out for any paths that lead west. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['get green key', 'explore west area', 'unlock green locked door', 'head north', 'move west', 'move west', 'move west', 'move west', 'move south', 'move south', 'move south', 'move south', 'move east', 'reach purple box column', 'reach column with purple box', 'move east', 'move east', 'move to purple box', 'move forward']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['reach purple box', 'find purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved.
