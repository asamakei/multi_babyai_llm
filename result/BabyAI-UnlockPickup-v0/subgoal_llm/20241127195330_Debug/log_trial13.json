After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move directly to the column with the purple box. I will then align myself with the purple box by turning right to face north, then move forward to the wall and turn right again to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles. By focusing on efficient navigation and avoiding unnecessary movements, I will achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move around the wall to the location of the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles.

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task efficiently, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key, then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move directly to the column with the purple box. I will then align myself with the purple box by turning right to face north, then move forward to the wall and turn right again to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles. By focusing on efficient navigation and avoiding unnecessary movements, I will achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move around the wall to the location of the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles.

Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn right to face the purple box, drop the green key, and then pick up the purple box to complete the mission.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['find green key', 'move around wall', 'move to purple box', 'move to wall before purple box', 'move east', 'move around green locked door', 'move to purple box location', 'move to purple box', 'align with purple box', 'move to purple box', 'align with purple box']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['move right to pick up purple box', 'drop green key', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. Output a detailed new plan from the start of the task to its accomplishment in 3 to 6 sentences \nGive only your plan:"
