  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To complete the task efficiently, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key, then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move directly to the column with the purple box. I will then align myself with the purple box by turning right to face north, then move forward to the wall and turn right again to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles. By focusing on efficient navigation and avoiding unnecessary movements, I will achieve the mission as soon as possible.",
