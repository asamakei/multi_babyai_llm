Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up. After obtaining the key, I will turn right to face the green locked door and open it. Then, I will move forward, turn left, and move forward to reach the column with the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will move forward to the wall, turn left to face the purple box, drop the green key, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up. After obtaining the key, I will turn right to face the green locked door and open it. Then, I will move forward, turn left, and move forward to reach the column with the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will move forward to the wall, turn left to face the purple box, drop the green key, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up. After obtaining the key, I will turn right to face the green locked door and move forward to it. Then, I will open the green locked door using the green key and move forward to explore the area.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

After obtaining the key, I will turn right to face the green locked door and open it. Then, I will move forward, turn left, and move forward to reach the column with the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will move forward to the wall, turn left to face the purple box, drop the green key, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up.
