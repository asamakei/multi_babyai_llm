  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move around the wall to the location of the purple box. I will then align myself with the purple box by turning right to face north, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission.",
