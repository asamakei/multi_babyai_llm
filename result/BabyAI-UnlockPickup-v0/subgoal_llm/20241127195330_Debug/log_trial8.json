Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 30:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".

After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door.

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\n\nThe following is your history:\nYou turned right.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou picked up green key.\nYou turned left.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned right.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned right.\nYou turned left.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned right.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou opened green locked door using the key.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou turned left.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned right.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou failed to picked up because you already have other item.\nYou dropped green key.\nYou turned left.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned right.\nYou picked up green key.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou turned right.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\". You are looking at north. You are at (1, 1). Your forward is (1, 0). Your right is (2, 1) Your left is (0, 1). You have green key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall in your forward coordinate (1, 0). There is no object in your right coordinate (2, 1). There is wall in your left coordinate (0, 1).\nYour think:I will turn left to face west, then move forward to the location (0, 1), and finally turn right to face north and move forward to the purple box, and pick it up to complete the mission. This will allow me to navigate around the wall and align myself with the purple box.\nYou turned left.\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\". You are looking at west. You are at (1, 1). Your forward is (0, 1). Your right is (1, 0) Your left is (1, 2). You have green key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (0, 3). There is wall at (0, 2).

There is wall in your right coordinate (1, 0). There is no object in your left coordinate (1, 2).\nYour think:I will turn left to face south, then move forward to the location (1, 2), and finally turn right to face west to align myself with the purple box. This will allow me to navigate around the wall and position myself to pick up the purple box.\nYou turned left.\nresult: FALIED\n\nYou are agent0. You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['pick up green key', 'explore west area', 'align with purple box', 'open green locked door', 'move left', 'move to purple box', 'align with purple box', 'open door', 'align with purple box', 'move to purple box column', 'move to wall', 'move forward', 'drop green key', 'move around green key']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['move around wall', 'move to purple box', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. Output a detailed new plan from the start of the task to its accomplishment in 3 to 6 sentences \nGive only your plan:"
