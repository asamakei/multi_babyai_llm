Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'use yellow key to open yellow locked door'. Don't output same meaning subgoal and don't use relative expressions and time-dependent expressions for agent. If it is concrete enough, the output may be taken from in your action names. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words.\nYour subgoal:"

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the grey box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 15:\nYou are at (4, 4). Your forward is (4, 5), south. Your right is (3, 4), west. Your left is (5, 4), east. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 5). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall in your forward coordinate (4, 5). There is no object in your right coordinate (3, 4). There is yellow locked door in your left coordinate (5, 4).\nYour action: turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 16:\nYou are at (4, 4). Your forward is (3, 4), west. Your right is (4, 3), north.
