Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'go to (3, 3)'. Don't output same meaning subgoal and don't use relative expressions and time-dependent expressions for agent. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If it is concrete enough, the output may be taken from in your action names. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words.\nYour subgoal:"

    "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the grey box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 29:\nYou are at (7, 2). Your forward is (6, 2), west. Your right is (7, 1), north. Your left is (7, 3), south. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 5). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 5). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (5, 5). There is yellow open door at (5, 4). There is wall at (5, 3). There is wall at (5, 2). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (6, 5). There is wall at (6, 0). There is wall at (7, 5). There is wall at (7, 0). There is yellow key in your forward coordinate (6, 2). There is no object in your right coordinate (7, 1). There is no object in your left coordinate (7, 3).\nYour action: turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 30:\nYou are at (7, 2). Your forward is (7, 1), north. Your right is (8, 2), east. Your left is (6, 2), west. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (6, 0). There is wall at (7, 0). There is wall at (8, 0). There is wall at (9, 0). There is wall at (10, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is grey box at (8, 1). There is wall at (10, 1). There is wall at (5, 2). There is wall at (10, 2). There is no object in your forward coordinate (7, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (8, 2). There is yellow key in your left coordinate (6, 2).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 31:\nYou are at (7, 1). Your forward is (7, 0), north. Your right is (8, 1), east. Your left is (6, 1), west. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (6, 0). There is wall at (8, 0). There is wall at (9, 0). There is wall at (10, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (10, 1). There is wall in your forward coordinate (7, 0). There is grey box in your right coordinate (8, 1). There is no object in your left coordinate (6, 1).\nYour action: turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 32:\nYou are at (7, 1). Your forward is (8, 1), east. Your right is (7, 2), south. Your left is (7, 0), north. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (10, 0). There is wall at (10, 1). There is wall at (10, 2). There is wall at (10, 3). There is wall at (10, 4). There is wall at (9, 0). There is wall at (8, 0). There is grey box in your forward coordinate (8, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (7, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (7, 0).\nYour think:To accomplish the task, I plan to go to the forward coordinate (8, 1) and then pick up the grey box.\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 33:\nYou are at (7, 1). Your forward is (8, 1), east. Your right is (7, 2), south. Your left is (7, 0), north. You have no item. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (10, 0). There is wall at (10, 1). There is wall at (10, 2). There is wall at (10, 3). There is wall at (10, 4). There is wall at (9, 0). There is wall at (8, 0). There is grey box in your forward coordinate (8, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (7, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (7, 0).\nYour think:To accomplish the task, I plan to pick up the grey box in my forward coordinate (8, 1). I will directly pick up the grey box without taking any additional steps.\nYour action: pick up item that in the forward coordinate\nYou picked up grey box.\n\nYou are agent0. In the previous step, you thought you should achieve ['pick up grey box in forward coordinate', 'pick up the grey box']. Was the subgoal 'pick up grey box in forward coordinate' achieved? Output only 'Yes' or 'No'.\nYes or No:"
