You achieved subgoals ['go to (1, 2)', 'go forward', 'go to (1, 2)', 'go to right coordinate', 'go to (1, 3)', 'go to (2, 3)', 'go to (3, 3)', 'go forward', 'go to (2, 3)', 'move to yellow key', 'pick up yellow key', 'go to (3, 3)', 'go east', 'go south', 'go to (3, 4)', 'go east', 'go east', 'go to (4, 4)', 'move to yellow locked door', 'open yellow locked door at (5, 4)', 'open door', 'open yellow locked door', 'go to (5, 4)', 'go to (6, 4)', 'go forward', 'go to (6, 4)', 'go east', 'go forward', 'go to (6, 4)', 'go to (7, 4)', 'go east', 'go forward', 'go to (7, 4)', 'move forward', 'go to (8, 4)', 'move to grey box', 'go to (8, 3)', 'go to left coordinate', 'go to (8, 2)', 'go forward', 'go to (8, 2)', 'move forward', 'go to left coordinate', 'go to (8, 1)', 'go to (9, 2)', 'go to right coordinate', 'go to (9, 2)', 'go to right coordinate']. You think you should achieve subgoals ['go to left', 'go to (8, 2)', 'drop key at (8, 1)', 'go to (8, 1)', 'go to left coordinate', 'drop key at (9, 1)', 'drop key', 'drop yellow key', 'pick up the grey box'] in order. Output more concrete subgoal to achieve 'go to left'. Don't output same meaning subgoal and don't use relative expressions and time-dependent expressions for agent. Considering other subgoals that you should achieve, don't output wasteful subgoal. If it is concrete enough, the output may be taken from in your action names. Output very appropriate subgoal in a few words.\nYour subgoal:"
