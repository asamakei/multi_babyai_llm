    "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the grey box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 45:\nYou are at (7, 1). Your forward is (8, 1), east. Your right is (7, 2), south. Your left is (7, 0), north. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (10, 0). There is wall at (10, 1). There is wall at (10, 2). There is wall at (10, 3). There is wall at (10, 4). There is wall at (9, 0). There is wall at (8, 0). There is grey box in your forward coordinate (8, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (7, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (7, 0).\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 46:\nYou are at (7, 1). Your forward is (7, 0), north. Your right is (8, 1), east. Your left is (6, 1), west. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (6, 0). There is wall at (8, 0). There is wall at (9, 0). There is wall at (10, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (10, 1). There is wall in your forward coordinate (7, 0). There is grey box in your right coordinate (8, 1). There is no object in your left coordinate (6, 1).\nYour action: drop carrying item to the forward coordinate\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 47:\nYou are at (7, 1). Your forward is (7, 0), north. Your right is (8, 1), east. Your left is (6, 1), west. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (6, 0).

There is grey box in your right coordinate (8, 1). There is no object in your left coordinate (6, 1).\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 48:\nYou are at (7, 1). Your forward is (6, 1), west. Your right is (7, 0), north. Your left is (7, 2), south. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is yellow open door at (5, 4). There is wall at (5, 3). There is wall at (5, 2). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (6, 0). There is no object in your forward coordinate (6, 1). There is wall in your right coordinate (7, 0). There is no object in your left coordinate (7, 2).\nYour think:I should go forward to the coordinate (6, 1), then turn right twice to face east and pick up the grey box in the forward coordinate (8, 1).\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 49:\nYou are at (6, 1). Your forward is (5, 1), west. Your right is (6, 0), north. Your left is (6, 2), south. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (0, 3).
