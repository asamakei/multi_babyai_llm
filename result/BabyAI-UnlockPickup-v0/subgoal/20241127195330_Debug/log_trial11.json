The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move around the wall to the location of the purple box. I will then align myself with the purple box by turning right to face north, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task efficiently, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key, then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move directly to the column with the purple box. I will then align myself with the purple box by turning right to face north, then move forward to the wall and turn right again to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles.

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move around the wall to the location of the purple box. I will then align myself with the purple box by turning right to face north, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task efficiently, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key, then open the green locked door.
