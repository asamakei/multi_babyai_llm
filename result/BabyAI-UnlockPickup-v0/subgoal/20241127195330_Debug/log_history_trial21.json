  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will move forward to the wall, then turn left to face the wall, drop the green key, turn right to face the purple box, and finally pick up the purple box.
