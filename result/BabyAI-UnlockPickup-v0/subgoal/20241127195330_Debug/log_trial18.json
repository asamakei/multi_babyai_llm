The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task efficiently, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move directly to the column with the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will move forward to the wall, then turn left to face the purple box, drop the green key, and finally pick up the purple box, completing the mission.

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will move forward to the wall, then turn left to face the purple box, drop the green key, and finally pick up the purple box, completing the mission.
