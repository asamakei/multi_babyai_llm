  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "I plan to start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, but also keep an eye out for any paths that lead west, as my previous attempt got stuck in the west area. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area further to see if I can find any new paths or objects that can help me achieve the mission. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area again by setting a mental timer to limit my exploration time in that area. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission. By prioritizing the north and west areas and setting a mental timer, I hope to achieve the mission more efficiently.",
