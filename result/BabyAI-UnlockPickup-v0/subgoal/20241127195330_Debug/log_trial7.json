Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, while also keeping an eye out for any paths that lead west. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 13:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, while also keeping an eye out for any paths that lead west. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 38:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, while also keeping an eye out for any paths that lead west. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 44:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".

After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible",

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the purple box, while also keeping an eye out for any paths that lead west. After obtaining the green key, I will prioritize exploring the west area, but set a more efficient route to avoid getting stuck. I will explore the west area in a more linear fashion, rather than backtracking, to make the most of my time. If I don't find the purple box in the north or west area, I will then explore the south area to see if I can find any clues or objects that can aid me in completing the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area and then head towards the purple box. I will avoid getting stuck in the west area by setting a mental timer and exploring in a more linear fashion. Once I have the key and have explored the west area, I will head towards the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\n\nThe following is your history:\nYou turned right.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou picked up green key.\nYou turned right.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou failed to open.\nYou turned left.\nYou turned right.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou opened green locked door using the key.\nYou turned left.\nYou turned right.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou took a step forward.\nYou turned right.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou failed to picked up because you already have other item.\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned right.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou failed to picked up because you already have other item.\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou turned right.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou failed to picked up because you already have other item.\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned right.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou failed to picked up because you already have other item.\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned left.\nYou failed to drop item because there is an object in your forward.\nYou turned right.\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward.\nYou failed to picked up because you already have other item.\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".
