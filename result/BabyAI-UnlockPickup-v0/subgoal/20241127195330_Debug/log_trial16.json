   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task efficiently, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move directly to the column with the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will move forward to the wall, then turn left to face the purple box, drop the green key, and finally pick up the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task efficiently, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move to green locked door', 'move behind green locked door']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['move to column with purple box', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved.
