You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up. After obtaining the key, I will turn right to face the green locked door and move forward to it. Then, I will open the green locked door using the green key and move forward to explore the area. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face the wall, drop the green key to free up my hands, and then turn right to face the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up. After obtaining the key, I will turn right to face the green locked door and move forward to it. Then, I will open the green locked door using the green key and move forward to explore the area. I will continue moving forward until I reach the column with the purple box, then turn left to face the wall and move down to the purple box, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task efficiently, I will start by turning left to face the green key and then pick it up. After obtaining the key, I will turn right to face the green locked door and move forward to it, then open the green locked door using the green key. Next, I will move forward until I reach the column with the purple box, then turn right to face the purple box, move forward to get closer to the purple box, and finally pick up the purple box in front of me to complete the mission.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible",
