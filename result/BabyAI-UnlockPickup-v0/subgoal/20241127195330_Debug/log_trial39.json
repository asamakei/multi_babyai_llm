You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['get green key', 'move forward', 'move forward to green locked door', 'move forward', 'move forward to green locked door', 'move forward', 'move forward to green locked door', 'move forward to green locked door', 'move forward to column', 'move forward to green locked door', 'move forward', 'move forward', 'move forward']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['open green locked door', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved.
