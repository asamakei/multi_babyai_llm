The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move around the wall to the location of the purple box.

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. I will then head directly to the column with the purple box, moving west until I reach it, and finally pick up the purple box to complete the mission. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 1:\nTo accomplish the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn left to face away from the purple box and the wall, then move forward to the wall and turn right to face the purple box, allowing me to pick it up without any obstacles. I will focus on efficient navigation and avoid unnecessary movements to achieve the mission as soon as possible.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I will start by exploring the north area to find the green key and then open the green locked door. After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move around the wall to the location of the purple box.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go to green key', 'find green key', 'go to west area', 'move around wall', 'move around wall', 'move to purple box', 'move to purple box', 'move to purple box', 'move forward', 'move to purple box', 'go to purple box', 'move to purple box', 'move to wall', 'move to wall']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['move to column with purple box', 'align with purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. Output a detailed new plan from the start of the task to its accomplishment in 3 to 6 sentences \nGive only your plan:"
