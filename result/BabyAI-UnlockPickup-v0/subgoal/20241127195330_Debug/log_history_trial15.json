  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

After obtaining the key, I will prioritize exploring the west area in a more linear fashion, avoiding backtracking to save time, and move directly to the column with the purple box. Once I reach the column with the purple box, I will turn right to face the purple box, drop the green key, and then pick up the purple box to complete the mission. By focusing on efficient navigation and avoiding unnecessary movements, I will achieve the mission as soon as possible.",
