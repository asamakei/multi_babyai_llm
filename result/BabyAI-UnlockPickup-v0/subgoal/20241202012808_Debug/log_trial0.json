Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the purple box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 14:\nYou are looking at west. You are at (2, 2). Your forward is (1, 2). Your right is (2, 1) Your left is (2, 3). You have green key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 5). There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (0, 3). There is wall at (0, 2). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 5). There is wall at (2, 0). There is no object in your forward coordinate (1, 2). There is no object in your right coordinate (2, 1). There is no object in your left coordinate (2, 3).\n> go forward\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 15:\nYou are looking at west. You are at (1, 2). Your forward is (0, 2). Your right is (1, 1) Your left is (1, 3). You have green key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 5). There is wall at (0, 4). There is wall at (0, 3). There is wall at (0, 2). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 5). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall in your forward coordinate (0, 2). There is no object in your right coordinate (1, 1). There is no object in your left coordinate (1, 3).\n> turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 16:\nYou are looking at north. You are at (1, 2). Your forward is (1, 1). Your right is (2, 2) Your left is (0, 2). You have green key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall at (0, 2). There is no object in your forward coordinate (1, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (2, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (0, 2).\n> go forward\nYou took a step forward.\ntime 17:\nYou are looking at north. You are at (1, 1). Your forward is (1, 0). Your right is (2, 1) Your left is (0, 1). You have green key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (0, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (0, 1). There is wall in your forward coordinate (1, 0). There is no object in your right coordinate (2, 1). There is wall in your left coordinate (0, 1).\nYour think:I would turn right to change my direction and move east, potentially finding the purple box. If there is no box in the next position, I would continue moving east and searching for the box.\n> turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 18:\nYou are looking at east. You are at (1, 1). Your forward is (2, 1). Your right is (1, 2) Your left is (1, 0). You have green key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 1). There is wall at (5, 2). There is wall at (5, 3). There is green locked door at (5, 4). There is wall at (4, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (1, 0). There is no object in your forward coordinate (2, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (1, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (1, 0).\n\nYou are agent0. Output what you think would accomplish the task in the current situation in 2 to 3 sentences.\nYour think:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI would go forward to move east and search for the purple box in the next position. If the box is not there, I would continue moving east and searching for the box, potentially finding it in the next few steps."
