  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position in grid is (column, row). Column 0 is west. Column 10 is east. Row 0 is north. Row 5 is south. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",
