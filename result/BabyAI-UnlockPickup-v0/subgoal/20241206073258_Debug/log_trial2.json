    "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. You cannot pick up any item if you have already item. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go to the forward coordinate', 'pick up item that in the forward coordinate', 'drop carrying item to the forward coordinate' or 'open the door at the forward coordinate'.\n\nHere is the task:\npick up the grey box\n\nThe following is your history:\ntime 45:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 1). Your forward is (4, 0), north. Your right is (5, 1), east. Your left is (3, 1), west. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall in your forward coordinate (4, 0). There is wall in your right coordinate (5, 1). There is no object in your left coordinate (3, 1).\nYour action: turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 46:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 1). Your forward is (5, 1), east. Your right is (4, 2), south. Your left is (4, 0), north. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 2). There is wall at (5, 3). There is yellow locked door at (5, 4). There is wall in your forward coordinate (5, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (4, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (4, 0).\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\ntime 47:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 1). Your forward is (4, 0), north. Your right is (5, 1), east. Your left is (3, 1), west. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (1, 0). There is wall at (2, 0). There is wall at (3, 0). There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall in your forward coordinate (4, 0). There is wall in your right coordinate (5, 1). There is no object in your left coordinate (3, 1).\nYour action: turn right\nYou turned right.\ntime 48:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 1). Your forward is (5, 1), east. Your right is (4, 2), south. Your left is (4, 0), north. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 2). There is wall at (5, 3). There is yellow locked door at (5, 4). There is wall in your forward coordinate (5, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (4, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (4, 0).\nYour think:To pick up the grey box, I should go west to (3, 1), then continue west to (2, 1) and (1, 1) and (0, 1), then pick up the grey box.\nYour action: go to the forward coordinate\nYou couldn't took a step forward because there is an object in your forward coordinate.\ntime 49:\nYour position is coordinate (4, 1). Your forward is (5, 1), east. Your right is (4, 2), south. Your left is (4, 0), north. You have yellow key. There is a passable floor in the area. There is wall at (5, 0). There is wall at (5, 2). There is wall at (5, 3). There is yellow locked door at (5, 4). There is wall in your forward coordinate (5, 1). There is no object in your right coordinate (4, 2). There is wall in your left coordinate (4, 0).\nYour think:I should go west to (3, 1), then continue west to (2, 1) and (1, 1) and (0, 1), then pick up the grey box.\nYour action: turn left\nYou turned left.\n\nIn the previous step, you thought you should achieve ['go to grey box', 'pick up the grey box']. Is the subgoal 'go to grey box' achieved? Output only 'Yes' or 'No'.\nYes or No:"
