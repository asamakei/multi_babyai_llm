  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. It is not possible to overlap objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward coordinate', 'drop the carrying item forward coordinate' or 'open the door in forward coordinate'.",
