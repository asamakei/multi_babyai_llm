      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have been more cautious when moving east towards the goal, as I fell off the cliff. To avoid this mistake, my new plan is to move east in shorter steps and check my surroundings before proceeding.\n\nSpecifically, I will:\n\n1. Move east for a few steps to get closer to the goal.\n2. Check if the next step to the east is safe (i.e., not a cliff).\n3. If it's safe, proceed with the next step to the east.\n4. If it's not safe, try to find an alternative route by moving north or south to bypass the cliff.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until I reach the goal.\n\nBy taking these precautions, I aim to avoid falling off the cliff and successfully reach the goal.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have been more cautious when moving south towards the cliff. To avoid this mistake, my new plan is to thoroughly check my surroundings before moving south.\n\nSpecifically, I will:\n\n1. Before moving south, check if the next step to the south is safe (i.e., not a cliff).\n2. If it's safe, proceed with the next step to the south.\n3. If it's not safe, try to find an alternative route by moving east or west to bypass the cliff.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until I reach the goal.\n\nBy taking these precautions, I aim to avoid falling off the cliff and successfully reach the goal.\nHere is the task:\nReach the goal as soon as possible without falling off the cliff.\nYour north is Nothing. Your south is Wall. Your east is Cliff. Your west is Wall. Goal is in 11 steps to your east. What is the best action to achieve your task in moving 'north', 'east', 'south' or 'west'? Output only result.\n>"
