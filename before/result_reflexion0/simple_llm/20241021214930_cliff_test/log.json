To avoid this mistake, my new plan is to move east in shorter steps and check my surroundings before proceeding.\n\nSpecifically, I will:\n\n1. Move east for a few steps to get closer to the goal.\n2. Check if the next step to the east is safe (i.e., not a cliff).\n3. If it's safe, proceed with the next step to the east.\n4. If it's not safe, try to find an alternative route by moving north or south to bypass the cliff.\n5.
