    "Based on the history of my past experience, I realized that I spent too much time navigating through the environment and didn't make efficient use of my movements. My new plan of action would be to:\n\n1. Start by turning right and moving south to get closer to the ball.\n2. Continue moving south until I reach the wall, then turn left to face east.\n3. Move east until I am one step away from the ball.\n4. Turn left to face north and move forward to pick up the ball.\n\nBy following this plan, I should be able to pick up the ball more efficiently and avoid wasting time navigating through the environment.",

Start by turning right and moving south to get closer to the ball.\n2. Continue moving south until I reach the wall, then turn left to face east.\n3. Move east until I am aligned with the ball.\n4. Turn right to face south and move forward to pick up the ball.\n\nThis revised plan accounts for the mistake of not aligning properly with the ball before attempting to pick it up."
