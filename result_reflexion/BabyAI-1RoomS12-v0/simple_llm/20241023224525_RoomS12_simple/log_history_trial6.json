  "Upon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time navigating through the environment without a clear plan to reach the ball. To correct this, my new plan is to initially turn right and head south to avoid the walls, then continue forward until I reach the ball's estimated location. I should have also paid closer attention to the ball's position relative to my movements and adjusted my path accordingly, rather than relying on trial and error. By doing so, I should be able to pick up the ball more efficiently.",

  "To improve my performance, I should have turned left earlier to avoid the walls and head directly towards the ball's estimated location. I should have also paid closer attention to the ball's position relative to my movements and adjusted my path accordingly, rather than relying on trial and error. A more efficient plan would be to initially turn right and head south, then continue forward while keeping track of the ball's location and making adjustments as needed.",
