    "To avoid falling off the cliff, I should have explored my surroundings more before moving east. A new plan of action would be:\n\n1. Move north to explore if there's a safe passage or an alternative route.\n2. If the north is still blocked or not viable, try moving west to see if there's a way to bypass the cliff.\n3. If the west is also blocked, try to find a way to safely navigate the cliff by moving east in smaller increments and checking the surroundings after each move.\n\nBy taking these steps, I can gather more information about the environment and find a safer path to the goal."
