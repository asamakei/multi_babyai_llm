    "Plan of action to reach the goal as soon as possible:\n\n1. From the current position, move west (away from the cliff) to avoid falling off.\n2. Since the wall is to the west and south, I will move north to explore the available space.\n3. Once I have moved north, I will check if there is any path to the east that would allow me to reach the goal. If there is, I will move east towards the goal.\n4. If there is no path to the east, I will move west again to re-examine the initial situation and reassess my options.\n\nBy taking these steps, I hope to avoid falling off the cliff and successfully reach the goal in the shortest time possible."
