      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on my past experience, I understand that I should not have moved east immediately.

Move west: Since I know that the wall is to my west, I will move west to get away from the cliff and avoid falling again.\n2. Explore north: I will move north to see what's ahead and get a better understanding of the environment. This might give me more information about the goal's location and any potential obstacles.\n3. Check the south: After exploring north, I will move south to see if there's a path to the goal. If there's a wall, I will know that I need to find an alternative route.\n4. Move east carefully: If I've determined that there's a path to the goal, I will move east slowly and cautiously, watching out for any cliffs or other obstacles.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I hope to avoid falling off the cliff again and reach the goal as soon as possible.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I understand that I should not have moved east immediately.
