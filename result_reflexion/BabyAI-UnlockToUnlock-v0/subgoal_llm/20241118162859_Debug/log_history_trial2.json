  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (15, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (15, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To achieve the mission of picking up the ball, I should have turned left at time 31 to head towards the purple locked door at (5,4) and then used the green key to unlock it, instead of going right and getting stuck. I should have also avoided going forward at time 35 and 39, and instead turned left to explore alternative paths. By doing so, I would have had a better chance of finding the ball and completing the mission within the time limit.",
