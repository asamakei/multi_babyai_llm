  "To achieve the mission of picking up the ball, I should have turned left at time 31 to head towards the purple locked door at (5,4) and then used the green key to unlock it, instead of going right and getting stuck.

Additionally, I should have gone around the wall by turning left at time 36 to find a possible path to the ball.",
