The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\nYour plan to achieve the mission:\n1.Agent0 pick up green key, agent1 pick up blue ball because it is obstacle to green door.\n2.Agent0 go to green door, agent1 drop blue ball away from the door.\n3.Agent0 open green door.\n4.Agent0 or agent1 go to the box and pick up it.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the mission, I should have picked up the green key first, then dropped the blue ball to clear the path, and finally opened the green door to access the box. I should have focused on completing these steps in a timely manner instead of repeatedly trying to meet Agent0 in front of the green door. By prioritizing the key and clearing the path, I would have been able to open the door and pick up the box within the time limit.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 20:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
