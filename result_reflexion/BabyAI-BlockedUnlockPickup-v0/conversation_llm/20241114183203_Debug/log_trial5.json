The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\nYour plan to achieve the mission:\n1.Agent0 pick up green key, agent1 pick up blue ball because it is obstacle to green door.\n2.Agent0 go to green door, agent1 drop blue ball away from the door.\n3.Agent0 open green door.\n4.Agent0 or agent1 go to the box and pick up it.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the mission, I should have turned left at time 28 to face east and then moved forward to pick up the green key at (1, 4). After obtaining the key, I should have moved towards the blue ball and picked it up to clear the path, then dropped it to the side. With the path clear, I should have moved towards the green door and opened it to access the box.\nTrial 1:\nI should have focused on finding the green key first by moving up to the northwest area, then picked it up to unlock the green door. After obtaining the key, I should have moved towards the blue ball, picked it up, and dropped it to the side to clear the path. With the path clear, I should have moved towards the green door, opened it, and then proceeded to pick up the box.\nTrial 2:\nI should have focused on moving up to get the green key first, instead of trying to navigate through the blue ball. I should have turned left at time 21 and gone up to reach the green key, then picked it up to unlock the green door. After obtaining the key, I should have moved towards the blue ball, picked it up, and dropped it to the side to clear the path, then moved towards the green door and opened it to access the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 20:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
