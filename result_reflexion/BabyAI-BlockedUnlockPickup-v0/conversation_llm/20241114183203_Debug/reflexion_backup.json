I should have turned left at time 21 and moved up to the green key, then picked it up and proceeded to the green door. After opening the door, I should have gone around the blue ball and met Agent1 at the box to pick it up together, or I should have gone directly to the box if the path was clear.",
   "My new plan is to prioritize picking up the green key first by moving up to get it directly, instead of going back and forth. I should have turned left at time 21 and moved up to the green key, then picked it up and proceeded to the green door. After picking up the green key, I should have moved towards the blue ball, and Agent1 should have moved the blue ball away from the green door, then I would have unlocked the green door and moved towards the box.",

I should have focused on finding the green key first instead of trying to navigate through the blue ball, and then worked with agent0 to open the green door and find the box.",
