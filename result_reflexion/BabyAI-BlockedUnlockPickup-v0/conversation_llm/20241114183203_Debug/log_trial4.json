The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\nYour plan to achieve the mission:\n1.Agent0 pick up green key, agent1 pick up blue ball because it is obstacle to green door.\n2.Agent0 go to green door, agent1 drop blue ball away from the door.\n3.Agent0 open green door.\n4.Agent0 or agent1 go to the box and pick up it.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the mission, I should have focused on moving up to get the green key first, instead of repeatedly trying to move forward.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\nYour plan to achieve the mission:\n1.Agent0 pick up green key, agent1 pick up blue ball because it is obstacle to green door.\n2.Agent0 go to green door, agent1 drop blue ball away from the door.\n3.Agent0 open green door.\n4.Agent0 or agent1 go to the box and pick up it.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the mission, I should have focused on moving up to get the green key first, instead of repeatedly trying to move forward. I should have turned left and gone up to reach the green key, then picked it up to unlock the green door. After that, I should have moved towards the box to pick it up, while avoiding obstacles like the blue ball.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the mission, I should have turned left at time 28 to face east and then moved forward to pick up the green key at (1, 4).

With the path clear, I should have moved towards the green door and opened it to access the box.\nTrial 2:\nI should have focused on finding the green key first by moving up to the northwest area, then picked it up to unlock the green door.
