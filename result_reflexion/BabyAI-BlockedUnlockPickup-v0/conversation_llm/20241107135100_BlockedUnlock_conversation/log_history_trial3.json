  "Upon reviewing my previous experience, I realize that I failed to complete the task within the given time limit. A key mistake was that I didn't make efficient use of my turns to navigate towards the box, leading to unnecessary backtracking and wasting time. A more effective strategy would have been to move east immediately after turning left, as this would have allowed me to bypass the walls and get closer to the box more quickly. To improve, I should have prioritized moving east after turning left, and then reassessed my position to decide on the final steps to pick up the box.",
