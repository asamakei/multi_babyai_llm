My new plan is to turn left and move forward to explore the area near the blue ball, then check if there's a box nearby. I should have turned left and moved forward to explore the area instead of repeatedly trying to move forward. Additionally, I should have used the green key to unlock the green locked door to access more areas and potentially find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I failed to pick up the box due to not properly exploring the area near the blue ball and not turning left to check the adjacent space.
