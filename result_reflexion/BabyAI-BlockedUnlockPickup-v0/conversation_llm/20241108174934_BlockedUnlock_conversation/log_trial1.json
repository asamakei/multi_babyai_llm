My new plan is to explore the environment more efficiently by turning right and moving forward to find the box, and then pick it up.

My new plan is to explore the environment more efficiently by turning right and moving forward to find the box, and then pick it up.

If I find anything, I'll let you know and we can coordinate our next steps.\nagent0:Sounds good, I'll turn right and move forward to explore the east area, let's meet back here and share our findings.\nagent1:I've moved forward and found a blue ball at (4, 4), but no box.

My new plan is to explore the environment more efficiently by turning right and moving forward to find the box, and then pick it up. I should have turned right and moved forward to explore the area instead of repeatedly trying to move forward west.

My new plan is to explore the environment more efficiently by turning right and moving forward to find the box, and then pick it up.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I was stuck in a loop and failed to pick up the box due to repeated attempts to move forward west. My new plan is to explore the environment more efficiently by turning right and moving forward to find the box, and then pick it up. I should have turned right and moved forward to explore the area instead of repeatedly trying to move forward west. By doing so, I would have found the box and completed the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\". You are facing north.
