   "Upon reflection, I realize that I failed to pick up the box due to not properly exploring the area near the blue ball and not turning left to check the adjacent space. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to explore the area near the blue ball, then check if there's a box nearby. I should have turned left and moved forward to explore the area instead of repeatedly trying to move forward. Additionally, I should have used the green key to unlock the green locked door to access more areas and potentially find the box.",

Additionally, I should have turned left to check the adjacent space and see if the box is there, near the blue ball."

   "Based on my past experience, I realize that I failed to pick up the box due to my inability to navigate the environment effectively and communicate with Agent0. My new plan is to start by turning west and moving forward to explore the area, then systematically search each row and communicate with Agent0 to coordinate our movements and avoid repetition. I should have also checked the area near the green key and blue ball more thoroughly, and considered dropping the blue ball to free my hands before attempting to pick up the box.",
