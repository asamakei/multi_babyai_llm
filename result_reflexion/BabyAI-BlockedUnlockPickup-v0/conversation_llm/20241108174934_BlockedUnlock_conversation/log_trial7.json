Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I failed to pick up the box due to my inability to navigate the environment effectively and communicate with Agent0. My new plan is to start by turning west and moving forward to explore the area, then systematically search each row and communicate with Agent0 to coordinate our movements and avoid repetition. I should have also checked the area near the green key and blue ball more thoroughly, and considered dropping the blue ball to free my hands before attempting to pick up the box.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I failed to pick up the box due to my inability to navigate the environment effectively and communicate with Agent0.
