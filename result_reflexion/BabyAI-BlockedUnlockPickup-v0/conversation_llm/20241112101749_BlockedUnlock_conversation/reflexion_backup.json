   "I should have moved more efficiently towards the east direction, as the green locked door was likely to be opened with the green key I was carrying. I should have also checked the area around me more thoroughly, especially the location of Agent1, to see if the box was nearby.

   "To complete the task of picking up the box, I should have turned left at time 21 to face south and gone forward to (1, 2) to check if the box was there. Then, I should have continued going forward to (1, 3) and (1, 4) to check the surrounding area. If the box was not found, I should have turned right to face east and gone forward to (2, 4) to check the remaining area. This plan would have allowed me to cover more ground and potentially find the box before running out of time."
