    "My new plan is to prioritize using the green key to unlock the green locked door as soon as possible, and then move forward to explore the area behind it to find the box. I should have checked my inventory earlier to confirm that I have the green key before attempting to unlock the door, and then proceed with the action to open the door. Additionally, I should have maintained clear communication with Agent1 to avoid confusion about the green key and focus on using it to unlock the door instead of going around the blue ball.",
    "My new plan is to prioritize moving directly to the green open door and going through it to find the box, as it is likely that the box is behind the door. I should have focused on going through the door instead of trying to go around the blue ball or moving up to find the box. I should have also maintained clear communication with Agent1 to avoid confusion about the location of the box and focus on going through the green open door.",

    "My new plan is to first focus on finding the green key by thoroughly searching the area around the blue ball, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. I should have moved forward to the blue ball and checked if the green key is there, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. Additionally, I should have regularly checked my inventory to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.",
    "I should have focused on picking up the green key from (1, 4) before attempting to unlock the green door. I should have moved down to (1, 4) to pick up the key and then proceeded to the green locked door to unlock it. Additionally, I should have regularly checked my inventory to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door and pick up the box, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.",
    "My new plan is to first move around the blue ball by going north, then east, and then south to check if the purple box is behind it, rather than trying to unlock the green door. If the box is not behind the blue ball, I should then proceed to unlock the green door using the green key and check if the box is behind it. This approach will help me avoid wasting time trying to unlock the door without checking the blue ball first."
