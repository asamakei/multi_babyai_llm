The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on finding the green key first, which is likely to be nearby the blue ball, and then use it to unlock the green locked door. I should have moved forward to the blue ball and checked if the green key is there, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. Once I have the green key, I will use it to unlock the green locked door and then move through it to check if the box is behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on finding the green key first by thoroughly searching the blue ball's original position, and then use it to unlock the green locked door. I should have also considered exploring the area behind the wall more efficiently to avoid wasting time. Additionally, I should have checked my inventory regularly to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on picking up the green key immediately and then used it to unlock the green locked door. I should have then moved through the unlocked door to search for the box, rather than trying to go around the blue ball or discussing the plan excessively.

I should have also considered exploring the area behind the wall more efficiently to avoid wasting time.

I should have moved forward to the blue ball and checked if the green key is there, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. Once I have the green key, I will use it to unlock the green locked door and then move through it to check if the box is behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on finding the green key first by thoroughly searching the blue ball's original position, and then use it to unlock the green locked door. I should have also considered exploring the area behind the wall more efficiently to avoid wasting time. Additionally, I should have checked my inventory regularly to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on picking up the green key immediately and then used it to unlock the green locked door. I should have then moved through the unlocked door to search for the box, rather than trying to go around the blue ball or discussing the plan excessively.
