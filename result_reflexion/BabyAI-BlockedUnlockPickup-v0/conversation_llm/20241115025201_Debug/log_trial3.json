The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have dropped the blue ball first to free up my hands, then picked up the green key, and finally used the key to unlock the green locked door to access the box. I should have prioritized picking up the green key over heading to the door, as it was a necessary step to unlock the door. I should have also been more efficient in my navigation, avoiding unnecessary turns and movements to save time.\nTrial 1:\nI should have focused on picking up the green key first, as it was a necessary step to unlock the green locked door. Instead of going around the wall, I should have gone directly to the green key and then used it to unlock the door. After unlocking the door, I should have gone through it to check if the box was behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to focus on finding the green key first, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. I should have moved towards the blue ball and checked if the green key is nearby, instead of trying to unlock the door without it. I will also make sure to be aware of my position and the blue ball to avoid any obstacles, and then use the green key to unlock the door and check if the box is behind it.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 19:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

    "My new plan is to move down to (1, 4) and unlock the green locked door earlier, then go through the door to check if the box is behind it. I should have also communicated more clearly with Agent1 to avoid confusion about the green key and focused on using the key to unlock the door instead of going around the blue ball. Additionally, I should have explored the area behind the door as soon as it was unlocked to find the box and complete the mission.",

I should have moved towards the blue ball and checked if the green key is nearby, instead of trying to unlock the door without it. I will also make sure to be aware of my position and the blue ball to avoid any obstacles, and then use the green key to unlock the door and check if the box is behind it.",

I should have avoided getting stuck in the loop by not turning left and right unnecessarily and instead focused on moving down to the green key. After unlocking the door, I should have moved through it to check if the box was behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball."
