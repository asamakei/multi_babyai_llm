The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have moved directly to the green key, picked it up, and then used it to unlock the green locked door. I should have avoided getting stuck in the loop by not turning left and right unnecessarily and instead focused on moving down to the green key. After unlocking the door, I should have moved through it to check if the box was behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to focus on finding the green key first, which is likely to be nearby the blue ball. I should move forward to the blue ball and check if the green key is there, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. Once I have the green key, I will use it to unlock the door and then move through it to check if the box is behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to use the green key to unlock the green locked door immediately after obtaining it, rather than turning left and right unnecessarily. I should have moved forward to the blue ball and then used the green key to unlock the green locked door, instead of trying to go around the blue ball.
