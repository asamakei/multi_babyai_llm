The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on finding the green key first by thoroughly searching the blue ball's original position, and then use it to unlock the green locked door. I should have also considered exploring the area behind the wall more efficiently to avoid wasting time. Additionally, I should have checked my inventory regularly to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on picking up the green key immediately and then used it to unlock the green locked door. I should have then moved through the unlocked door to search for the box, rather than trying to go around the blue ball or discussing the plan excessively. Additionally, I should have regularly checked my inventory to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to focus on finding the green key first by thoroughly searching the area around the blue ball, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. I should have moved forward to the blue ball and checked if the green key is there, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. Additionally, I should have regularly checked my inventory to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 20:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
