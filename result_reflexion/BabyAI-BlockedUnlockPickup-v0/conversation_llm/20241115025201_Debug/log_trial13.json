I should have moved forward to the blue ball and checked if the green key is there, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. Additionally, I should have regularly checked my inventory to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to focus on finding the green key first by thoroughly searching the area around the blue ball, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it.
