Additionally, I should have regularly checked my inventory to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to first move up to the blue ball and check if the green key is there, then use the key to unlock the green door. After that, I should move east and check if the purple box is behind the blue ball or if it's behind the green door. I should also regularly check my inventory to ensure I have the necessary items to pick up the box, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to first focus on finding the green key by thoroughly searching the area around the blue ball, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nMy new plan is to focus on finding the green key first by thoroughly searching the area around the blue ball, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. I should have moved forward to the blue ball and checked if the green key is there, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. Additionally, I should have regularly checked my inventory to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to first move up to the blue ball and check if the green key is there, then use the key to unlock the green door. After that, I should move east and check if the purple box is behind the blue ball or if it's behind the green door. I should also regularly check my inventory to ensure I have the necessary items to pick up the box, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to first focus on finding the green key by thoroughly searching the area around the blue ball, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it.
