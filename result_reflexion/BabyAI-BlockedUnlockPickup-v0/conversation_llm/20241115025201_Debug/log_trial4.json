The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI should have focused on picking up the green key first, as it was a necessary step to unlock the green locked door. Instead of going around the wall, I should have gone directly to the green key and then used it to unlock the door. After unlocking the door, I should have gone through it to check if the box was behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to focus on finding the green key first, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. I should have moved towards the blue ball and checked if the green key is nearby, instead of trying to unlock the door without it. I will also make sure to be aware of my position and the blue ball to avoid any obstacles, and then use the green key to unlock the door and check if the box is behind it.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I should have moved directly to the green key, picked it up, and then used it to unlock the green locked door. I should have avoided getting stuck in the loop by not turning left and right unnecessarily and instead focused on moving down to the green key. After unlocking the door, I should have moved through it to check if the box was behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 0:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI should have focused on picking up the green key first, as it was a necessary step to unlock the green locked door. Instead of going around the wall, I should have gone directly to the green key and then used it to unlock the door. After unlocking the door, I should have gone through it to check if the box was behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to focus on finding the green key first, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. I should have moved towards the blue ball and checked if the green key is nearby, instead of trying to unlock the door without it. I will also make sure to be aware of my position and the blue ball to avoid any obstacles, and then use the green key to unlock the door and check if the box is behind it.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I should have moved directly to the green key, picked it up, and then used it to unlock the green locked door. I should have avoided getting stuck in the loop by not turning left and right unnecessarily and instead focused on moving down to the green key. After unlocking the door, I should have moved through it to check if the box was behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 20:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
