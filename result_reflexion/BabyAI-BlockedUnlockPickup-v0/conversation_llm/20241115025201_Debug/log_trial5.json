I should have moved towards the blue ball and checked if the green key is nearby, instead of trying to unlock the door without it. I will also make sure to be aware of my position and the blue ball to avoid any obstacles, and then use the green key to unlock the door and check if the box is behind it.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I should have moved directly to the green key, picked it up, and then used it to unlock the green locked door. I should have avoided getting stuck in the loop by not turning left and right unnecessarily and instead focused on moving down to the green key. After unlocking the door, I should have moved through it to check if the box was behind it, rather than trying to go around the blue ball.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to focus on finding the green key first, which is likely to be nearby the blue ball. I should move forward to the blue ball and check if the green key is there, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it.
