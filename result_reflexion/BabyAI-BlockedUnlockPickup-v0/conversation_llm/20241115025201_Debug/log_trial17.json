I should have moved forward to the blue ball and checked if the green key is there, rather than trying to unlock the green locked door without it. Additionally, I should have regularly checked my inventory to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.\nTrial 1:\nI should have focused on picking up the green key from (1, 4) before attempting to unlock the green door. I should have moved down to (1, 4) to pick up the key and then proceeded to the green locked door to unlock it. Additionally, I should have regularly checked my inventory to ensure I had the necessary items to unlock the door and pick up the box, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth movements.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to first move around the blue ball by going north, then east, and then south to check if the purple box is behind it, rather than trying to unlock the green door. If the box is not behind the blue ball, I should then proceed to unlock the green door using the green key and check if the box is behind it.
