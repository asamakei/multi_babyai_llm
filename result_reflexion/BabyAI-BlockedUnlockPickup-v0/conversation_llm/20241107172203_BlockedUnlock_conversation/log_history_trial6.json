  "Upon reviewing the past experience, I realize that we should have instructed agent1 to \"go forward\" to move one step north after picking up the green key to see what's ahead, instead of turning right, to avoid getting stuck in a dead-end area. We should have also instructed agent1 to \"go forward\" again after picking up the green key to move one step east and see what's ahead, instead of turning right, to explore the area and potentially find a path to the box. To correct this, I suggest we should instruct agent1 to \"go forward\" after \"pick up the object in front\" to move one step north and see what's ahead, and then \"go forward\" again to move one step east and see what's ahead. This will give us more information about our surroundings and potentially lead us to the box. By doing so, we can avoid getting stuck in a dead-end area and find a more efficient path to the box.",
