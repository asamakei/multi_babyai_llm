   "Upon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I should have instructed agent1 to \"go forward\" at step 5 to move one step south and get a better view of the surroundings and assess what's ahead, considering the green locked door to our east and the potential path to the box. I should have also instructed agent1 to \"go forward\" at step 16 to position ourselves to unlock the green locked door with the green key and \"go forward\" at step 20 to position ourselves to pick up the box more efficiently. To achieve the mission, I will instruct agent1 to \"turn right\" at the beginning to face east, then \"go forward\" at step 5 to move one step south, \"go forward\" at step 16 to unlock the green locked door, and \"go forward\" at step 20 to position ourselves to pick up the box more efficiently.",

   "Upon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I should have taken a more direct approach to the green locked door. At step 28, I should have instructed agent0 to \"unlock the green locked door\" to unlock the green locked door using the green key we obtained earlier, considering the walls to our east and the potential path to the box. This would have allowed us to bypass unnecessary steps and get closer to the box. I should have also instructed agent0 to \"go forward\" to move one step east and get a better view of the surroundings and assess what's ahead, considering the green locked door to our west and the potential path to the box. By taking these actions, we can unlock the green locked door and proceed towards the box more efficiently.",
