To correct this, I suggest we instruct agent1 to \"go forward\" to move one step north after \"pick up the object in front\" at step 20, to move one step east and see what's ahead, and then \"go forward\" again to move one step east and see what's ahead, allowing us to position ourselves to move towards the green key more efficiently and potentially unlock it to proceed towards the box.",
