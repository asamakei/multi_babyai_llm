You are at (1, 3).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the best action**\n\nTo achieve the task, you need to move forward to reach the box. However, there is a wall in front of you at (0, 2). You cannot move forward.\n\n**Step 4: Consider alternative actions**\n\nYou can turn left or right to change your direction. Turning left would put you at (1, 2), and turning right would put you at (1, 4). Neither of these directions allows you to move forward.\n\n**Step 5: Consider picking up the object**\n\nYou can pick up the object at your front, but there is no object in front of you.\n\n**Step 6: Consider dropping the carrying object"

       "To solve the task, we need to navigate through the grid world and reach the goal. \n\nSince we are green triangle and can only observe our forward, we need to turn right to see the entire grid. \n\nAfter turning right, we can see that the goal is to the right of us. \n\nWe can move forward to reach the goal. \n\nOnce we reach the goal, we can pick it up. \n\nTherefore, the best action to achieve the task is to turn right and then go forward and pick up the object at my front.\n\nAnswer: turn right, go forward, pick up the object at my front."
