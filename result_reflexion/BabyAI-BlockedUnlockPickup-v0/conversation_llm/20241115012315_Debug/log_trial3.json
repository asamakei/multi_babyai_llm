The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI should have moved north to (1, 4) to pick up the green key earlier, instead of waiting and trying to navigate around the walls. Once I had the green key, I should have moved east to find the green locked door and unlock it to access new areas. Then, I should have explored the new areas to find the box, rather than trying to navigate through the walls and getting stuck.\nTrial 1:\nI should have moved north to (1, 4) to pick up the green key earlier, instead of waiting and trying to navigate around the walls.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI should have moved north to (1, 4) to pick up the green key earlier, instead of waiting and trying to navigate around the walls. Once I had the green key, I should have moved east to find the green locked door and unlock it to access new areas. Then, I should have explored the new areas to find the box, rather than trying to navigate through the walls and getting stuck.\nTrial 1:\nI should have moved north to (1, 4) to pick up the green key earlier, instead of waiting and trying to navigate around the walls.

Once I had the green key, I should have moved east to find the green locked door and unlock it to access new areas. Then, I should have explored the new areas to find the box, rather than trying to navigate through the walls and getting stuck.\nTrial 1:\nI should have moved north to (1, 4) to pick up the green key earlier, instead of waiting and trying to navigate around the walls.
