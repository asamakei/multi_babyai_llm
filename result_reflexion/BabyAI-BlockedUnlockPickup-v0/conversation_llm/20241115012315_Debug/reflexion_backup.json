   "To complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on obtaining the green key first and then unlocking the green door. Instead of going back and forth, I should have moved directly to the green key location (1, 4) and picked it up, then proceeded to unlock the green door. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with agent1 to coordinate our efforts and avoid redundant exploration.",
