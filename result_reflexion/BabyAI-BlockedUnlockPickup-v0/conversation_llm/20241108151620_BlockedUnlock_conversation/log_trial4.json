A more efficient plan would have been to move forward to the locked door at step 20, turn left to face north at step 21, and pick up the key at step 22. Then, I could have moved forward to the locked door at step 23 and opened it with the key, allowing me to access the exit. I should have executed the action \"pick up the object in front\" at step 21 to pick up the key.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nstep 0:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

To do this, I should have moved forward to position myself at (1, 4) to get closer to the key. Then, I should have picked up the key before moving forward to the locked door to open it.
