   "Upon reflection, I realize that I should have focused more on navigating to the locked door and picking up the key before attempting to open it. I should have moved forward to the locked door at step 20 and picked up the key at step 22, rather than trying to move forward to the exit multiple times. A more efficient plan would have been to move forward to the locked door at step 20, turn left to face north at step 21, and pick up the key at step 22. Then, I could have moved forward to the locked door at step 23 and opened it, allowing me to access the exit. I should have executed the action \"pick up the object in front\" at step 18 to pick up the key.",

   "Upon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I should have prioritized picking up the key after opening the locked door. I should have moved forward to the locked door, turned left to face north, and then moved forward to open the door. Once the door is open, I should have moved forward to position myself at (5, 5) to get a better view of the exit and the box. From there, I should have turned right to face east and moved forward to position myself at (5, 4) to open the locked door with the key.",
   "Upon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I should have prioritized picking up the key at (1, 4) before attempting to open the locked door at (5, 4). To do this, I should have moved forward to position myself at (1, 4) to get closer to the key. Then, I should have picked up the key before moving forward to the locked door to open it. This would have allowed me to proceed to the exit without running out of time. My new plan should involve moving forward to (1, 4) and picking up the key before opening the locked door.",
