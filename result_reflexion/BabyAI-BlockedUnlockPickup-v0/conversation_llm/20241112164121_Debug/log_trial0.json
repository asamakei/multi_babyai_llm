Instead of focusing solely on the immediate forward direction, I should have also considered moving in other directions, such as left, right, and backward, to gather more information about the environment. Additionally, I should have paid closer attention to the potential obstacles and their locations, as this would have allowed me to plan my movements more effectively.

Instead of focusing solely on the immediate forward direction, I should have also considered moving in all directions (up, down, left, and right) to gather more information about the environment. This would have allowed me to identify potential obstacles and plan my path accordingly. Additionally, I should have prioritized actions based on their potential impact on the task, such as moving towards the goal or away from obstacles. By doing so, I would have been better equipped to adapt and make decisions that maximize my chances of completing the task within the given time frame."
