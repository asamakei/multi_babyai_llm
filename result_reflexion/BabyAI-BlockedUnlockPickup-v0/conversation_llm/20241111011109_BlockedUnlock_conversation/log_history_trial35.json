  "Upon reflecting on my past experience, I realize that I should have turned right to face north as soon as I reached the x-axis to directly proceed to the locked door at (5, 4) instead of moving forward and turning right multiple times.

By doing so, I could have avoided unnecessary steps and completed the task more efficiently.
