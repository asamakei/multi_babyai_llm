  "Upon reflecting on my past experience, I realize that I should have prioritized picking up the green key at (1, 4) first, as it will allow us to unlock the door at (5, 4) later on. However, I got stuck in a loop of moving forward and discussing with agent1 about which object to pick up first. To correct this, I should have turned right as soon as I reached the x-axis to face north and moved forward to (5, 4) to pick up the green key directly.
