  "Upon reflecting on my previous attempt, I realize that I was too focused on moving north to reach the box and didn't adequately consider the locked door in the way.

To rectify this, I should have turned right to face east and moved forward to get closer to the locked door after reaching (3, 1), rather than continuing to move north.
