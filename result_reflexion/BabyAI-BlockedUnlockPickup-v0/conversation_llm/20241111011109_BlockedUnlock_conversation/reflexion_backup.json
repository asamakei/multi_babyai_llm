   "Upon reflecting on my past experience, I realize that I should have turned right to face north as soon as I reached the x-axis to directly proceed to the locked door at (5, 4) instead of moving forward and turning right multiple times. I should have then moved forward to (1, 4) to pick up the green key, turned right to face north, and moved forward to (5, 4) to unlock the door. After unlocking the door, I should have proceeded to (5, 5) to pick up the box. By doing so, I could have avoided unnecessary steps and completed the task more efficiently. My new plan involves turning right to face north as soon as I reach the x-axis, moving forward to (1, 4) to pick up the green key, turning right to face north, and then moving forward to (5, 4) to unlock the door.",
   "Upon reflecting on my past experience, I realize that I should have prioritized moving forward to (1, 4) to pick up the green key first, then turning right to face north so I can move towards the locked door at (5, 4). After that, I should have proceeded to (5, 4) to unlock the door and then moved forward to (5, 5) to pick up the box. However, I failed to consider the optimal path and ended up stuck with the green key, resulting in the failure to complete the task. My new plan involves moving forward to (1, 4) to pick up the green key first, then turning right to face north and proceeding to (5, 4) to unlock the locked door, and finally moving forward to (5, 5) to pick up the box.",

   "Upon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I failed to prioritize picking up the green key at (1, 4) first, which is crucial for unlocking the locked door at (5, 4) to access the box. To rectify this, I should have turned right to face north after reaching (3, 1) to proceed directly to (1, 4) to pick up the green key, rather than moving forward and getting stuck in the east direction. I should then have proceeded to (5, 4) to unlock the door and then moved forward to (5, 5) to pick up the box. This will allow me to complete the mission as soon as possible. My new plan is to move forward to (3, 2), then turn right to face north, move forward to (1, 4) to pick up the green key, turn right to face east, move forward to (5, 4) to unlock the door, and finally move forward to (5, 5) to pick up the box.",
