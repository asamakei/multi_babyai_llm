  "Upon reflecting on my previous attempt, I realize that I was overly focused on moving east to get closer to the locked door at (5, 4) without adequately considering the optimal route to the box at (4, 3). To rectify this, I should have turned right to face north after reaching the green key at (1, 4), so I could move forward and get closer to the locked door from a different angle. This would have allowed me to unlock the locked door and proceed to the box more efficiently. My revised plan is to turn right to face north, then move forward to get closer to the locked door, and finally use the green key to unlock it and access the box.
