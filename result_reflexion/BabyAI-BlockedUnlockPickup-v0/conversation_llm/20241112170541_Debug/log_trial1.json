After picking up the green key, I would go south from my current position at (1, 3) to (1, 4) to collect the key, then navigate east towards (2, 4) to access the door at (5, 4) for a quicker route back. Instead of looping between (4, 0) and (4, 1), I should have moved directly south towards the exit after picking up the box and then used strategic turns to avoid walls.
