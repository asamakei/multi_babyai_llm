   "To efficiently pick up the box at (4, 4), I should first turn to face east from my starting position at (4, 1). Then, I should go forward to (4, 2), (4, 3), and finally reach (4, 4) to pick up the blue ball. After picking up the item, I will head south to (4, 0) immediately, instead of looping unnecessarily. Finally, I will navigate east from (4, 0) and then continue south to reach the exit at (0, 0) without getting sidetracked by previous plans.",
   "To successfully pick up the green key at (1, 4), I should have immediately moved forward from my starting position at (1, 3) to (1, 4) to collect it. After picking up the key, I should head directly southeast to (2, 4) and then continue to (3, 4) to regroup with agent1 quickly. Once together, we can efficiently strategize and proceed to pick up the box at (4, 3) without unnecessary delays. This direct approach avoids looping and ensures that we maintain our focus on completing the task in a timely manner."

   "To complete the task efficiently, I should have prioritized picking up the green key located at (1, 4) before attempting to proceed towards the exit. After picking up the green key, I would go south from my current position at (1, 3) to (1, 4) to collect the key, then navigate east towards (2, 4) to access the door at (5, 4) for a quicker route back. Instead of looping between (4, 0) and (4, 1), I should have moved directly south towards the exit after picking up the box and then used strategic turns to avoid walls. Finally, I should have coordinated better with Agent0 for a streamlined approach towards the exit to ensure we navigate efficiently without repeating steps.",
   "To complete the task efficiently, I should prioritize picking up the green key at (1, 4) as it will aid in accessing the box and any doors along the way. I need to directly move south to (1, 4) to collect the key, then proceed to regroup with Agent0 at (3, 4) where we can strategize together. After regrouping, we should both head to (4, 3) to pick up the box in a coordinated manner. This strategy will help us avoid running out of time and ensure we don't backtrack unnecessarily."
