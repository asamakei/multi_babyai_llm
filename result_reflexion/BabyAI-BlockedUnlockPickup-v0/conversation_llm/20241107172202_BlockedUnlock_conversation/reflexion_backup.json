   "Upon reviewing the past experience, I realize that I should have instructed agent1 to \"go forward\" at step 5 to move one step east to get a better view of the surroundings and assess what's ahead, considering the green key to the west and the walls to our north. I should have also instructed agent1 to \"go forward\" at step 16 to position ourselves to unlock the green locked door with the green key and \"go forward\" at step 20 to position ourselves to pick up the box more efficiently. Additionally, I should have instructed agent1 to \"turn right\" at the beginning to face east to get a better view of the surroundings and assess what's ahead. To achieve the mission, I will instruct agent1 to \"turn right\" at the beginning to face east, then \"go forward\" at step 5 to move one step east, \"go forward\" at step 16 to unlock the green locked door, and \"go forward\" at step 20 to position ourselves to pick up the box more efficiently.",

   "Upon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I should have taken a more direct approach to the green locked door. At step 29, I should have instructed agent0 to \"go forward\" to move one step east to get a better view of the surroundings and assess what's ahead, positioning us to unlock the green locked door more efficiently. I should have also instructed agent0 to \"unlock the object in front\" to unlock the green locked door, which is in front of us, using the green key we obtained earlier. This would have allowed us to bypass unnecessary steps and get closer to the box. By taking these actions, we can unlock the green locked door and proceed towards the box more efficiently.",
