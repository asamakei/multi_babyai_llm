Instead of going back and forth, I should have also explored the area behind me to see if the box was there. Additionally, I should have communicated more clearly with Agent1 to coordinate our actions and avoid repetition.\\nTrial 1:\\nI should have prioritized communicating with Agent1 to coordinate our actions and avoid repetition.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI should have moved forward and picked up the blue ball earlier to determine if it was the key to unlock the green locked door or find the box. Instead of going back and forth, I should have also explored the area behind me to see if the box was there. Additionally, I should have communicated more clearly with Agent1 to coordinate our actions and avoid repetition.\nTrial 1:\nI should have prioritized communicating with Agent1 to coordinate our actions and avoid repetition. A better plan would be to move forward to (2, 1), then turn right to face east, and move forward to (3, 1) to meet Agent1, and then move east together to reach the green locked door at (5, 4) and use the key to unlock it.
