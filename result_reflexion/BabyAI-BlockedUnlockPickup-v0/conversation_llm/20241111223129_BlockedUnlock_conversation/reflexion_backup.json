   "I should have moved forward and picked up the blue ball earlier to determine if it was the key to unlock the green locked door or find the box. Instead of going back and forth, I should have also explored the area behind me to see if the box was there. Additionally, I should have communicated more clearly with Agent1 to coordinate our actions and avoid repetition.",
   "I should have prioritized communicating with Agent1 to coordinate our actions and avoid repetition. A better plan would be to move forward to (2, 1), then turn right to face east, and move forward to (3, 1) to meet Agent1, and then move east together to reach the green locked door at (5, 4) and use the key to unlock it. This plan ensures we work together efficiently and make the most of our time.",

This would have saved time and allowed me to complete the task before running out of time.",
