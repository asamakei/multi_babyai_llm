  "After re-examining the past experience, I realized that I failed to complete the task due to running out of time. A key mistake was that I didn't take a more efficient path to the exit, getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and back. A more effective strategy would be to move south and then right, avoiding the wall and getting closer to the exit sooner. I should have also prioritized finding the green key to unlock the locked door, which would have given me a clear path to the exit. By incorporating these adjustments, I believe I can complete the task successfully in the future.",
