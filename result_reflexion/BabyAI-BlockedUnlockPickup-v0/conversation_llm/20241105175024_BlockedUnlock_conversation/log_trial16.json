A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 3:\nI should have moved directly south to pick up the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box, avoiding unnecessary turns and movements.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 3:\nI should have moved directly south to pick up the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box, avoiding unnecessary turns and movements.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 3:\nI should have moved directly south to pick up the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 3:\nI should have moved directly south to pick up the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 3:\nI should have moved directly south to pick up the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box, avoiding unnecessary turns and movements.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 3:\nI should have moved directly south to pick up the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box, avoiding unnecessary turns and movements.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 3:\nI should have moved directly south to pick up the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 3:\nI should have moved directly south to pick up the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box, avoiding unnecessary turns and movements.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 3:\nI should have moved directly south to pick up the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box, avoiding unnecessary turns and movements.
