    "To complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly south to get the green key, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the green key, pick it up, move north to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box.

    "To complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.",

    "I should have picked up the green key first and then used it to unlock the green locked door, instead of trying to move east without the key. A better plan would be to pick up the green key, turn right, and then move east to unlock the green locked door, ensuring that I have the key in my inventory before attempting to unlock the door. This plan accounts for my previous mistake of trying to unlock the door without the key."
