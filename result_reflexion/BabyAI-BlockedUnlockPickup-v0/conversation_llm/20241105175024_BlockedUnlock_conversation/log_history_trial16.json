  "To complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly west to get the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally moved east to find the box. A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box.
