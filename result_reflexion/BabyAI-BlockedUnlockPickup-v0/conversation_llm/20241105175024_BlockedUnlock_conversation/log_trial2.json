Maybe the green key we saw earlier can be used to unlock the box. What is the best action to achieve your task in 'turn right', 'turn left', 'go forward', 'pick up', 'drop', or 'toggle'?

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions.

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions.

To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time attempting to pick up the box while already carrying it, and failed to make progress towards opening it. A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction.

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions.

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time attempting to pick up the box while already carrying it, and failed to make progress towards opening it. A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time attempting to pick up the box while already carrying it, and failed to make progress towards opening it. A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction.

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time attempting to pick up the box while already carrying it, and failed to make progress towards opening it. A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction.

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission.

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\\nTrial 1:\\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction.

A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time attempting to pick up the box while already carrying it, and failed to make progress towards opening it. A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time attempting to pick up the box while already carrying it, and failed to make progress towards opening it. A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time attempting to pick up the box while already carrying it, and failed to make progress towards opening it. A more effective plan would be to first ensure I am not already carrying the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. To achieve this, I should have taken actions such as checking my inventory before attempting to pick up the box, and avoiding redundant pick up actions.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the box, then picked it up, and finally turned around to face the correct direction.
