This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 4:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

A better plan would be to pick up the green key, turn right, and then move east to unlock the green locked door, ensuring that I have the key in my inventory before attempting to unlock the door. This plan accounts for my previous mistake of trying to unlock the door without the key.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box.

Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.\nTrial 2:\nI should have picked up the green key first and then used it to unlock the green locked door, instead of trying to move east without the key. A better plan would be to pick up the green key, turn right, and then move east to unlock the green locked door, ensuring that I have the key in my inventory before attempting to unlock the door. This plan accounts for my previous mistake of trying to unlock the door without the key.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box.

A better plan would be to pick up the green key, turn right, and then move east to unlock the green locked door, ensuring that I have the key in my inventory before attempting to unlock the door. This plan accounts for my previous mistake of trying to unlock the door without the key.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box.

A better plan would be to pick up the green key, turn right, and then move east to unlock the green locked door, ensuring that I have the key in my inventory before attempting to unlock the door. This plan accounts for my previous mistake of trying to unlock the door without the key.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box.

I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box.

Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.\nTrial 2:\nI should have picked up the green key first and then used it to unlock the green locked door, instead of trying to move east without the key. A better plan would be to pick up the green key, turn right, and then move east to unlock the green locked door, ensuring that I have the key in my inventory before attempting to unlock the door. This plan accounts for my previous mistake of trying to unlock the door without the key.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box.

Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.\nTrial 2:\nI should have picked up the green key first and then used it to unlock the green locked door, instead of trying to move east without the key. A better plan would be to pick up the green key, turn right, and then move east to unlock the green locked door, ensuring that I have the key in my inventory before attempting to unlock the door. This plan accounts for my previous mistake of trying to unlock the door without the key.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions.

A more efficient plan would be to move west until reaching the green key, pick it up, move east to unlock the green locked door, and then move east to find the box. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 4:\nBased on my past experience, I realize that I should have moved directly east to unlock the green locked door with the green key first, and then moved south to pick up the box. A more efficient plan would be to move east until reaching the green locked door, unlock it with the green key, and then move south to find the box.

Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.\nTrial 2:\nI should have picked up the green key first and then used it to unlock the green locked door, instead of trying to move east without the key. A better plan would be to pick up the green key, turn right, and then move east to unlock the green locked door, ensuring that I have the key in my inventory before attempting to unlock the door. This plan accounts for my previous mistake of trying to unlock the door without the key.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions. Additionally, I should have communicated more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid confusion, specifically by confirming our plan to unlock the door together before taking action.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved south to reach the green key, then picked it up, and finally used it to unlock the green locked door to access the box. I should have also checked my inventory before attempting to pick up the box to avoid redundant actions.
