This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly towards the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally searched for the box behind it. A more efficient plan would be to move west to get the green key, then move south to unlock the green locked door, and finally move east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move west to get the green key, then move south to unlock the green locked door, and finally move east to find the box.

A more efficient plan would be to move south until reaching the box, then pick it up, and finally open it to complete the mission. This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have focused on moving directly towards the green key first, then used it to unlock the green locked door, and finally searched for the box behind it.

This plan avoids unnecessary turns and movements, saving time and increasing the chances of success.",
