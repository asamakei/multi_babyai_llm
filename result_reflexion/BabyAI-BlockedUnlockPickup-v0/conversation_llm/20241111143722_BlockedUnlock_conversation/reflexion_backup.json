   "Upon reviewing my previous attempt, I realize that I should have prioritized getting the green key first, as it's crucial for opening the door to the box. Instead of focusing on the blue ball, I should have turned around to face east and moved forward to get closer to the green key at time 22. I should have then moved forward to get closer to the green key at time 23, and picked up the green key at time 24.",
   "After reviewing the past experience, I realize that I should have prioritized getting the green key earlier and more efficiently. To correct this, I should have turned around to face east at time 22 and moved forward to get closer to the green key at time 23. I should have then picked up the green key at time 24, turned around to face east, and moved forward to get closer to the box. With the green key in hand, I should have proceeded to move east to reach the box."

   "Upon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I focused too much on getting the green key, but failed to consider the blue ball's significance in reaching the box. I should have prioritized picking up the blue ball first, as it's located at (4, 4), which is closer than the green key. I should have moved south to pick up the blue ball, then turned right to face east and moved forward to get closer to the green key, which would have given me a better chance to complete the task within the time limit.",

I should have moved south to pick up the blue ball, then turned right to face east and moved forward to get closer to the green key. However, I should have also considered the locked door at (5, 4) and planned my actions accordingly, such as moving east to get closer to the door before picking up the green key. My new plan should be to move south to pick up the blue ball, then turn right to face east, move forward to get closer to the locked door, and finally pick up the green key to unlock the door and proceed with the box."
