Since we're in a cooperative relationship, let's discuss our next steps together to ensure we're both on the same path.\nagent0:I think moving forward to (4, 3) is a good initial step, but considering the wall at (0, 3), we should also plan to turn right to face east after moving forward to (4, 3) to get a clear path to the box. This way, we can proceed towards the box without hitting the wall. What do you think, agent1?\nagent1:I think turning right to face east after moving forward to (4, 3) is a good idea, but we should also consider the wall at (4, 5) and the blue ball at (4, 4) in our path to the box.
