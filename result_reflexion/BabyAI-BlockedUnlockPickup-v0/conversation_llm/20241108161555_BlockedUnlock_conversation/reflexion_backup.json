   "Upon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right more times to face the green locked door directly instead of moving forward in the same direction. I should have also considered the layout of the walls and the position of the green key to access the box more efficiently. A more efficient path would have been to turn right at the start to face the green locked door directly and then move forward to (2, 3) to get closer to the green key. I should have also taken note of the blue ball's position and considered its potential use in accessing the box indirectly. With this new plan, I can attempt to complete the task by moving forward to (2, 2), turning right to face east, and then moving forward to (3, 2) to get closer to the green key.",

   "In my previous attempt, I failed to complete the task because I didn't take into account the wall at (5, 0) and (5, 1) that blocked my path to the green locked door. A new plan of action should involve turning left to face north after reaching the wall at (5, 3), then moving forward to (4, 3), and finally turning right to face east to proceed towards the green locked door. I should also pick up the green key at (1, 4) before unlocking the green locked door to ensure I have the necessary object to complete the task. By doing so, I can avoid the wall at (5, 0) and (5, 1) and reach the green locked door more efficiently.",
