  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.",

  "Upon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right more times to face the box directly instead of moving forward in the same direction. I should have also considered the layout of the walls and the position of the box to avoid getting stuck in a dead-end. A more efficient path would have been to turn right at the start to face the box directly and then move forward. I should have also taken note of the green key's position and considered its potential use in unlocking the green locked door to access the box. With this new plan, I can attempt to complete the task again.",

  "Upon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I didn't properly account for the wall in my path to the box. I should have turned left to face the box directly when I was facing north, instead of turning right which led me away from the box. My new plan is to turn left immediately after facing north, so that I can move forward and pick up the box as soon as possible. I will also make sure to keep track of my position and the walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck.",

  "In my previous attempt, I failed to complete the task because I didn't take into account the wall at (5, 0) and (5, 1) that blocked my path to the green locked door. A new plan of action should involve turning left to face north after reaching the wall at (5, 3), then moving forward to (4, 3), and finally turning right to face east to proceed towards the green locked door. By doing so, I can avoid the wall at (5, 0) and (5, 1) and reach the green locked door more efficiently.
