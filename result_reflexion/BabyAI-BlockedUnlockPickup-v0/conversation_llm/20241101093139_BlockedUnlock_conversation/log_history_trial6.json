  "In my previous attempt, I focused too much on exploring the newly unlocked area and didn't systematically search the original area thoroughly. To improve my strategy, I would have prioritized exploring the original area more methodically, using a grid-based approach to ensure I didn't miss any possible locations for the box. I would have also considered using the green key to unlock any potential locked doors that could lead to the box.",
  "Trial 1:",
  "Upon reflection, I realize that my initial strategy focused too much on exploring the area to the right after finding the green key, rather than systematically searching the original area more thoroughly. To improve my strategy, I should have prioritized using the green key to unlock the green locked door and then explored the area to the right more methodically, using a grid-based approach to ensure I didn't miss any possible locations for the box. I should have also considered searching the area to the right more thoroughly before moving forward, in case the box was hidden there. To achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should have used the green key to unlock the green locked door and then moved 1 step forward and 1 step right to explore the area to the right more thoroughly, rather than getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left.",
