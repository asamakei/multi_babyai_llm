To improve my strategy, I should have prioritized using the green key to unlock the green locked door and then explored the area to the right more methodically, using a grid-based approach to ensure I didn't miss any possible locations for the box. I should have also considered searching the area to the right more thoroughly before moving forward, in case the box was hidden there.
