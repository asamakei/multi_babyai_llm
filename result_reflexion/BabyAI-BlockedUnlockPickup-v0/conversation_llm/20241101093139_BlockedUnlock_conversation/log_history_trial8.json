  "In the past experience, I was unsuccessful in completing the task because I failed to systematically search the original area thoroughly, getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left. To improve my strategy, I should have prioritized using the green key to unlock the green locked door and then explored the area to the right more methodically, using a grid-based approach to ensure I didn't miss any possible locations for the box. I should have also considered searching the area to the right more thoroughly before moving forward, in case the box was hidden there. To achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should have used the green key to unlock the green locked door and then moved 1 step forward and 1 step right to explore the area to the right more thoroughly.",
