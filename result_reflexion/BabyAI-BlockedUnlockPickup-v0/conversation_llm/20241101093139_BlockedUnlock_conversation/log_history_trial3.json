I should have prioritized exploring the original area more thoroughly, paying closer attention to the layout of the walls and any potential hidden passages. To improve my strategy, I would focus on more methodically searching the original area, using a grid-based approach to ensure I don't miss any possible locations for the box. I would also consider using the green key to unlock any potential locked doors that could lead to the box.",
