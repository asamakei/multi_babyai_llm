I should have avoided unnecessary turns and movements that wasted time, and instead, moved directly to the key and then to the door.",

A more efficient plan would be to move south to grab the key, then head east to unlock the green door, and finally enter the room to find the box. I should also communicate more effectively with Agent0 to coordinate our actions and avoid repetition, ensuring we meet at the green locked door and enter the room together to pick up the box.",
