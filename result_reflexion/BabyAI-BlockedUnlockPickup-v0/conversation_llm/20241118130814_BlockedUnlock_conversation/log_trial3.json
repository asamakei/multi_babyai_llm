      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on heading directly to (1, 4) to retrieve the green key instead of turning left and right unnecessarily. I should have taken a more direct route to the green key and then used it to unlock the green door, which might have led me to the box. By avoiding unnecessary turns and focusing on the key, I could have saved time and completed the task.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on moving around the blue ball to get a better angle on the green locked door, rather than trying to open it directly.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on heading directly to (1, 4) to retrieve the green key instead of turning left and right unnecessarily. I should have taken a more direct route to the green key and then used it to unlock the green door, which might have led me to the box. By avoiding unnecessary turns and focusing on the key, I could have saved time and completed the task.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on moving around the blue ball to get a better angle on the green locked door, rather than trying to open it directly.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on heading directly to (1, 4) to retrieve the green key instead of turning left and right unnecessarily. I should have taken a more direct route to the green key and then used it to unlock the green door, which might have led me to the box. By avoiding unnecessary turns and focusing on the key, I could have saved time and completed the task.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on moving around the blue ball to get a better angle on the green locked door, rather than trying to open it directly. I should have turned left, then moved forward to position myself next to the door, and then used the green key to unlock it. This approach would have allowed me to bypass the blue ball and access the door more effectively.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on moving around the blue ball to the left to get a better angle on the green door, rather than trying to pick it up or moving back and forth.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have focused on heading directly to (1, 4) to retrieve the green key instead of turning left and right unnecessarily. I should have taken a more direct route to the green key and then used it to unlock the green door, which might have led me to the box.
