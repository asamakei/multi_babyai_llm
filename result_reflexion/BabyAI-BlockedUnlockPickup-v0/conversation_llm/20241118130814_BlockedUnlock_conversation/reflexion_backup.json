   "To complete the task, I should have moved around the blue ball to the left to get a better angle on the green locked door, rather than trying to move around it to the right. I should have turned left at time 22 and moved forward to position myself next to the green locked door, then used the green key to unlock it. This approach would have allowed me to bypass the blue ball and access the door more effectively.",
   "To complete the task, I should have focused on moving around the blue ball to the left to get a better angle on the green door, rather than trying to pick it up or moving back and forth. I should have turned left at time 22 and moved forward to position myself next to the green door, then used the green key to unlock it. By avoiding unnecessary turns and focusing on moving around the blue ball, I could have saved time and completed the task.",

   "To complete the task, I should have picked up the blue ball first to clear the path, then moved it out of the way, and headed towards the green locked door to find the green key. However, since I already have the green key, I should have directly headed towards the green locked door instead of going around the blue ball, and used the key to unlock it, which might have led to the box. I should not have wasted time trying to find another route or moving around the blue ball without picking it up first, and instead focused on finding the green door and unlocking it."
