      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission.
