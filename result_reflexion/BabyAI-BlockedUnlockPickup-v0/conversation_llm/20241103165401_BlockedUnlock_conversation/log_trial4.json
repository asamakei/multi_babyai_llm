I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door to unlock it and see what's behind it.\nTrial 2:\nMy previous attempts were unsuccessful because I didn't effectively utilize the green key to unlock the green locked door and didn't follow through with the mission objective. To correct this, I plan to first use the green key to unlock the green locked door, then go right to see if the box is behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 3:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

To correct this, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door to unlock it and see what's behind it.\nTrial 2:\nMy previous attempts were unsuccessful because I didn't effectively utilize the green key to unlock the green locked door and didn't follow through with the mission objective. To correct this, I plan to first use the green key to unlock the green locked door, then go right to see if the box is behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 3:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door to unlock it and see what's behind it.\nTrial 1:\nMy previous attempt was unsuccessful due to not fully utilizing the information given to me about the environment and not following through with the mission objective. To correct this, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door to unlock it and see what's behind it.\nTrial 2:\nMy previous attempts were unsuccessful because I didn't effectively utilize the green key to unlock the green locked door and didn't follow through with the mission objective. To correct this, I plan to first use the green key to unlock the green locked door, then go right to see if the box is behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 3:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

My new plan of action would be to immediately pick up the box and examine its contents, then head towards the green locked door and use the green key to unlock it. I should have also avoided unnecessary turns and focused on the most direct path to the box and the door.

To correct this, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door to unlock it and see what's behind it.\nTrial 2:\nMy previous attempts were unsuccessful because I didn't effectively utilize the green key to unlock the green locked door and didn't follow through with the mission objective. To correct this, I plan to first use the green key to unlock the green locked door, then go right to see if the box is behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 3:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nMy previous attempt was unsuccessful due to not fully utilizing the information given to me about the environment and not following through with the mission objective. To correct this, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door to unlock it and see what's behind it.\nTrial 1:\nMy previous attempt was unsuccessful due to not fully utilizing the information given to me about the environment and not following through with the mission objective.

    "To correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time."
