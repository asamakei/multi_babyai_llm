My new plan of action would be to immediately pick up the box and examine its contents, then head towards the green locked door and use the green key to unlock it. I should have also avoided unnecessary turns and focused on the most direct path to the box and the door. By streamlining my actions and prioritizing the task, I believe I can complete the mission more efficiently.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

My new plan of action would be to immediately pick up the box and examine its contents, then head towards the green locked door and use the green key to unlock it. I should have also avoided unnecessary turns and focused on the most direct path to the box and the door. By streamlining my actions and prioritizing the task, I believe I can complete the mission more efficiently.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I should have also avoided unnecessary turns and focused on the most direct path to the box and the door.

The keycard has a label that says \"use with red door\" and the map appears to be a layout of the surrounding area. What do you think our next course of action should be?\nagent1:Agent0, now that we have the keycard and the map, I think our next course of action should be to find the red door and use the keycard to unlock it, then examine the area behind the red door to see if we can find any other clues or objects that can help us with our mission.\n> turn left\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
