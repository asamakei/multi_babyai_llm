To correct this, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door to unlock it and see what's behind it.\nTrial 1:\nMy previous attempt was unsuccessful due to not fully utilizing the information given to me about the environment and not following through with the mission objective.
