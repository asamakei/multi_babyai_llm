Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path.

By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 4:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

Shall we try moving left and see if we can find the box?\nagent1:I agree that we should focus on finding the box first, but I think we should consider the location of the green key and the green locked door as well.

I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 3:\nMy previous attempts were unsuccessful because I didn't effectively utilize the green key to unlock the green locked door and didn't follow through with the mission objective. To correct this, I plan to first use the green key to unlock the green locked door, then go right to see if the box is behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 4:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path.

To correct this, I plan to first use the green key to unlock the green locked door, then go right to see if the box is behind it.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it.

I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path.

By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 3:\nMy previous attempts were unsuccessful because I didn't effectively utilize the green key to unlock the green locked door and didn't follow through with the mission objective. To correct this, I plan to first use the green key to unlock the green locked door, then go right to see if the box is behind it.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it.

I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first pick up the box as intended, then examine its contents to see if it has any clues or tools that can help with the next course of action. Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission. By following this plan, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.\nTrial 2:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path.

Next, I will use the green key to unlock the green locked door, which I should have done earlier, and examine what's behind it. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the box and the blue ball to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nTrial 1:\nTo correct my previous mistakes, I plan to first focus on finding the box by going right, as it seems to be the most direct path. I should have also paid closer attention to the location of the green key and the green locked door, and considered whether they were necessary to access the box. Additionally, I will make sure to prioritize picking up the box over exploring the green locked door, as it is the primary objective of the mission.
