Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have taken a more direct approach. Upon entering the environment, I should have moved forward and turned left to face east, then proceeded to move forward until I reached the green locked door. I should have then used the key to unlock the door and picked up the box immediately, instead of moving back and forth and wasting time.
