A better plan would be to pick up the box, then examine it immediately to see if it has any clues or useful information.

Upon entering the environment, I should have moved forward and turned left to face east, then proceeded to move forward until I reached the green locked door. I should have then used the key to unlock the door and picked up the box immediately, instead of moving back and forth and wasting time. This plan would have allowed me to complete the task more efficiently and effectively."
