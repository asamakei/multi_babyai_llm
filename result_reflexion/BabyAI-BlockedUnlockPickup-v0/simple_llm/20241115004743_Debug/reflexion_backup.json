   "To complete the task successfully, I should first pick up the green key at (1, 4) by moving towards it. I will turn left to face east, go forward to (4, 4), then navigate around the walls to reach (1, 4) and pick up the key. After securing the key, I will return to (4, 4), turn right to face south, and then move forward to (5, 4) to open the green locked door. Finally, I can go through the door and pick up the box in the next step.",

Upon reaching (4, 1), I will turn left to face north and then go forward to (4, 2), (4, 3), and finally to (4, 4) where the box is located. Once there, I will pick up the box and complete the mission."
