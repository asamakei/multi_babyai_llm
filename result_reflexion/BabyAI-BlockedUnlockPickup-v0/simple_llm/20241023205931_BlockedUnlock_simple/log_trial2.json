I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door. To devise a new plan of action, I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face east to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward** to move towards the blue locked door.\n6. **Use the blue key** to unlock the blue locked door.\n7. **Go forward** to move through the unlocked door.\n8. **Go forward** again to reach the box and **pick it up**.\n\nThis revised plan should help me avoid getting stuck in a loop and make progress towards completing the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nTrial 1:\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I kept moving in circles and didn't make any progress towards the box due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.

    "To devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**",
