I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

    "To devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the given environment and the path I took to attempt to complete the task.\n\nInitially, I was placed in a grid world environment with a mission to \"pick up the box.\" I was facing east and had to navigate through the grid to reach the box. I made several attempts to move forward, but I kept getting stuck due to the presence of walls and the blue locked door.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that I was stuck in a loop, moving forward and turning left/right without making any progress towards the box. I should have taken a more strategic approach by first identifying the location of the blue key and the blue locked door, which seemed to be crucial in accessing the box.\n\nHere's a revised plan of action:\n\n1. **Turn right** to face west to get a better view of the grid and identify the location of the blue key and the blue locked door.\n2. **Go forward** to move towards the blue key, which seems to be located in a relatively open area.\n3. **Go forward** again to reach the blue key and **pick it up**.\n4. **Turn left** to face north to access the blue locked door.\n5. **Go forward**",
