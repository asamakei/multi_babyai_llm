   "To complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first used the green key to unlock the green locked door at (5,4) by selecting the 'open the door in forward' action while facing the door and carrying the key. After unlocking the door, I should have moved east to explore the area and find the box, instead of repeating the 'open the door in forward' action. I should have also checked the area south of the door for the box's location, as it was not specified where the box was located.",
   "To complete the task of picking up the box, I should have first moved west from my initial position to pick up the green key at (1,4), then moved east to reach the green locked door at (5,4) and used the key to unlock it. After unlocking the door, I should have moved east to explore the area and find the box, checking both the east and south directions for the box's location. I should have also avoided getting stuck at the wall by turning around and exploring the area more thoroughly.",

Then, I should have moved east to explore the area and find the box, checking both the east and south directions for the box's location. I should have also avoided getting stuck at the wall by turning around and exploring the area more thoroughly, specifically by turning right after reaching the wall at (5,2) and moving forward to explore the south direction."
