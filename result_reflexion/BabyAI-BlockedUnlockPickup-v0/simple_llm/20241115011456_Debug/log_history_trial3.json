  "My new plan is to first move around the wall by going west from the starting position, then head south to reach the blue ball, pick it up, and continue south to reach the green locked door. After that, I will use the green key to unlock the door and go through it to find the box. This plan avoids the mistake of getting stuck in front of the wall and not being able to pick up the blue ball, which was a crucial step in the original attempt.",
