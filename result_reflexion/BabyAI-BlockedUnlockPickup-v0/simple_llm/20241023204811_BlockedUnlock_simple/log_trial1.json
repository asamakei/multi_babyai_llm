      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6.

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left.

Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left.

Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6.

Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left.

Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4.

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6.

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4.

The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

    "After reviewing the history of the past experience, I have identified the mistake that led to the failure to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\", but I was unable to find the box due to an inefficient path and incorrect decision-making. The key to success lies in finding the purple key first, which unlocks the purple locked door and leads to the box.\n\nMy initial mistake was not turning left immediately after entering the environment. I should have turned left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key, which was located in 3 steps forward and 3 steps left. This would have allowed me to reach the key before encountering the wall and the blue ball.\n\nA revised plan of action would be:\n\n1. Turn left as soon as possible to head towards the purple key.\n2. Move forward and left to reach the purple key.\n3. Pick up the purple key.\n4. Use the purple key to unlock the purple locked door.\n5. Move through the unlocked door to reach the box.\n6. Pick up the box.\n\nBy following this revised plan, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.",
