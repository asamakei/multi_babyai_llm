This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate to the Box**:\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate to the Box**:\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate to the Box**:\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

    "**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate",
