I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nTrial 1:\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\nAfter analyzing my previous attempts, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time. This was due to my initial strategy of moving forward without exploring the environment and identifying potential paths to the box.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: I should have taken the time to explore the grid and gather information about the layout of the walls, including the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: I should have tried to locate the box's position and considered alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Use the green key**: I should have used the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n\n**New Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Exploration**: Move forward and explore the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls and the positions of the green key and the box.\n2. **Identify the Box's Location**: Use the information gathered to try to locate the box's position and consider alternative paths to reach it.\n3. **Unlock Doors**: If the box is not directly accessible, use the green key to unlock doors and access new areas of the grid.\n4. **Navigate\nTrial 2:\nAfter re-examining my past experience, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led to running out of time.
