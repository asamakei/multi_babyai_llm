      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement.

However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

    "To devise a new plan of action, I will analyze the provided environment and my previous attempts to complete the task.\n\nThe task was to \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible. I was given a grid world environment with various walls and a green key. My initial strategy was to move forward and try to reach the box. However, I realized that I was stuck in a loop of moving forward and right, which led me to run out of time.\n\nUpon re-examining the environment, I noticed that there are multiple walls in the grid, which limited my movement. I should have taken a more systematic approach to explore the environment and find a path to the box.\n\nHere's a new plan of action:\n\n1. **Explore the environment**: Start by moving forward and exploring the grid to gather information about the layout of the walls.\n2. **Identify the box's location**: Once I have a better understanding of the environment, I will try to locate the box's position.\n3. **Find the shortest path**: Using the information gathered, I will attempt to find the shortest path to the box, taking into account the walls and the green key.\n4. **Use the green key**: If the box is not directly accessible, I will use the green",
