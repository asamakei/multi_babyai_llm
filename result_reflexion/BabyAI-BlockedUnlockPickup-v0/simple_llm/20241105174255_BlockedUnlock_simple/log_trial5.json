Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box.

I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the given history, I realize that I should have taken a more direct approach to reach the box instead of getting stuck in an infinite loop of moving north. I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door.

I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the given history, I realize that I should have taken a more direct approach to reach the box instead of getting stuck in an infinite loop of moving north. I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door.

I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door.

To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door.

I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the given history, I realize that I should have taken a more direct approach to reach the box instead of getting stuck in an infinite loop of moving north. I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the given history, I realize that I should have taken a more direct approach to reach the box instead of getting stuck in an infinite loop of moving north. I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the given history, I realize that I should have taken a more direct approach to reach the box instead of getting stuck in an infinite loop of moving north. I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the given history, I realize that I should have taken a more direct approach to reach the box instead of getting stuck in an infinite loop of moving north. I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the given history, I realize that I should have taken a more direct approach to reach the box instead of getting stuck in an infinite loop of moving north. I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

I should have turned left immediately after reaching the green key to head east towards the box. Upon reaching the green key, I should have turned left and moved east to find the box.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 3:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
