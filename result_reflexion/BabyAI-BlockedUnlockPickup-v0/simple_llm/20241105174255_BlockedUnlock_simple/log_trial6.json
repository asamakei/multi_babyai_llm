To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 1:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 1:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box.

A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 1:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 1:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box.

A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 1:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 1:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box.

A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 1:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 1:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box.

A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box.\nTrial 1:\nAfter reviewing the past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box. To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.\nTrial 2:\nAfter reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving east repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move south to reach the green locked door directly. I should have moved south first, then turned right to head east towards the green locked door, and then continued moving east until I reached the door. Upon reaching the door, I should have turned left and moved south to find the box.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving south repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly. I should have turned right immediately after the initial movement, then moved east until I reached the box.

To achieve this, I should have moved east first, then turned right to head south towards the box, and then continued moving east until I reached the box.",
