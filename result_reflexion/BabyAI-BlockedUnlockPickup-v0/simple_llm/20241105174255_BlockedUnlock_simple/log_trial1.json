    "Upon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I got stuck in an infinite loop by moving north repeatedly without making progress towards the box. A more efficient approach would be to initially move east to reach the box directly, rather than moving north. To achieve this, I should have turned right immediately after the initial north movement, then moved east until I reached the box."
