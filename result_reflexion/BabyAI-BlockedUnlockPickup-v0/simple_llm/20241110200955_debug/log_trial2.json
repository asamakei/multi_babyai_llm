Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo succeed in this mission, I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. I should have also been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo succeed in the mission of \"pick up the box,\" I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible.

From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. Additionally, I should have been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\n1. Move forward to the first intersection.\n2. Turn right to avoid the wall.\n3. Move forward to reach the goal.\n4.
