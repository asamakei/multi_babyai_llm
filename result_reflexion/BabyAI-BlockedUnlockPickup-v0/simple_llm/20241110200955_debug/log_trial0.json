    "To succeed in this mission, I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. I should have also been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently."
