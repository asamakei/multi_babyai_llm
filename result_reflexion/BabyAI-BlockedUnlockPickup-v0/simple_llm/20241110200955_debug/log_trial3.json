Be more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation**\n\nI am a red triangle in an environment with a green key, a blue ball, and a wall. My task is to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mistake**\n\nI ran out of time because I did not move forward quickly enough to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a new plan of action**\n\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the green key as soon as possible and then moved forward to the blue ball. I should have also moved forward to the goal as soon as I reached the blue ball.\n\n**Step 4: Outline the new path**\n\n1. Move forward to the green key.\n2. Move forward to the blue ball.\n3. Move forward to the goal.\n\n**Answer**: Move forward to the green key. Move forward to the blue ball.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo succeed in this mission, I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. I should have also been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo succeed in the mission of \"pick up the box,\" I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. Additionally, I should have been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\n1. Move forward to the first intersection.\n2. Turn right to avoid the wall.\n3. Move forward to reach the goal.\n4. Be more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation**\n\nI am a red triangle in an environment with a green key, a blue ball, and a wall. My task is to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mistake**\n\nI ran out of time because I did not move forward quickly enough to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a new plan of action**\n\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the green key as soon as possible and then moved forward to the blue ball. I should have also moved forward to the goal as soon as I reached the blue ball.\n\n**Step 4: Outline the new path**\n\n1. Move forward to the green key.\n2. Move forward to the blue ball.\n3. Move forward to the goal.\n\n**Answer**: Move forward to the green key. Move forward to the blue ball.

The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo succeed in this mission, I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. I should have also been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo succeed in the mission of \"pick up the box,\" I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. Additionally, I should have been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\n1. Move forward to the first intersection.\n2. Turn right to avoid the wall.\n3. Move forward to reach the goal.\n4. Be more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation**\n\nI am a red triangle in an environment with a green key, a blue ball, and a wall. My task is to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mistake**\n\nI ran out of time because I did not move forward quickly enough to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a new plan of action**\n\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the green key as soon as possible and then moved forward to the blue ball. I should have also moved forward to the goal as soon as I reached the blue ball.\n\n**Step 4: Outline the new path**\n\n1. Move forward to the green key.\n2. Move forward to the blue ball.\n3. Move forward to the goal.\n\n**Answer**: Move forward to the green key. Move forward to the blue ball. Move forward to the goal.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\". You are facing north. You are at (3, 3). Wall is at (0, 0).

My task is to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mistake**\n\nI ran out of time because I did not move forward quickly enough to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a new plan of action**\n\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the green key as soon as possible and then moved forward to the blue ball. I should have also moved forward to the goal as soon as I reached the blue ball.\n\n**Step 4: Outline the new path**\n\n1. Move forward to the green key.\n2. Move forward to the blue ball.\n3. Move forward to the goal.\n\n**Answer**: Move forward to the green key. Move forward to the blue ball. Move forward to the goal.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\". You are facing north. You are at (3, 3). Wall is at (0, 0).

The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo succeed in this mission, I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. I should have also been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo succeed in the mission of \"pick up the box,\" I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. Additionally, I should have been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\n1. Move forward to the first intersection.\n2. Turn right to avoid the wall.\n3. Move forward to reach the goal.\n4. Be more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation**\n\nI am a red triangle in an environment with a green key, a blue ball, and a wall. My task is to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mistake**\n\nI ran out of time because I did not move forward quickly enough to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a new plan of action**\n\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the green key as soon as possible and then moved forward to the blue ball. I should have also moved forward to the goal as soon as I reached the blue ball.\n\n**Step 4: Outline the new path**\n\n1. Move forward to the green key.\n2. Move forward to the blue ball.\n3. Move forward to the goal.\n\n**Answer**: Move forward to the green key. Move forward to the blue ball. Move forward to the goal.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\". You are facing north. You are at (3, 3). Wall is at (0, 0).

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo succeed in this mission, I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. I should have also been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo succeed in the mission of \"pick up the box,\" I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. Additionally, I should have been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\n1. Move forward to the first intersection.\n2. Turn right to avoid the wall.\n3. Move forward to reach the goal.\n4. Be more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation**\n\nI am a red triangle in an environment with a green key, a blue ball, and a wall. My task is to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mistake**\n\nI ran out of time because I did not move forward quickly enough to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a new plan of action**\n\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the green key as soon as possible and then moved forward to the blue ball. I should have also moved forward to the goal as soon as I reached the blue ball.\n\n**Step 4: Outline the new path**\n\n1. Move forward to the green key.\n2. Move forward to the blue ball.\n3. Move forward to the goal.\n\n**Answer**: Move forward to the green key. Move forward to the blue ball.

The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo succeed in this mission, I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. I should have also been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo succeed in the mission of \"pick up the box,\" I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible. I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. Additionally, I should have been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\n**New Plan of Action:**\n\n1. Move forward to the first intersection.\n2. Turn right to avoid the wall.\n3. Move forward to reach the goal.\n4. Be more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation**\n\nI am a red triangle in an environment with a green key, a blue ball, and a wall. My task is to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mistake**\n\nI ran out of time because I did not move forward quickly enough to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a new plan of action**\n\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the green key as soon as possible and then moved forward to the blue ball. I should have also moved forward to the goal as soon as I reached the blue ball.\n\n**Step 4: Outline the new path**\n\n1. Move forward to the green key.\n2. Move forward to the blue ball.\n3. Move forward to the goal.\n\n**Answer**: Move forward to the green key. Move forward to the blue ball. Move forward to the goal.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\". You are facing north. You are at (3, 3). Wall is at (0, 0).

I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. I should have also been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo succeed in the mission of \"pick up the box,\" I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible.

Turn right to avoid the wall.\n3. Move forward to reach the goal.\n4. Be more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation**\n\nI am a red triangle in an environment with a green key, a blue ball, and a wall. My task is to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mistake**\n\nI ran out of time because I did not move forward quickly enough to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a new plan of action**\n\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the green key as soon as possible and then moved forward to the blue ball. I should have also moved forward to the goal as soon as I reached the blue ball.\n\n**Step 4: Outline the new path**\n\n1. Move forward to the green key.\n2. Move forward to the blue ball.\n3.

I should have started by moving forward to the first intersection, where I would have encountered the box. From there, I should have turned right to avoid the wall and continued moving forward to reach the goal. I should have also been more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo succeed in the mission of \"pick up the box,\" I should have focused on finding the box as quickly as possible.

Be more careful not to run out of time by moving more quickly and efficiently.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to complete the task successfully and pick up the box.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation**\n\nI am a red triangle in an environment with a green key, a blue ball, and a wall. My task is to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the mistake**\n\nI ran out of time because I did not move forward quickly enough to reach the goal.\n\n**Step 3: Devise a new plan of action**\n\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the green key as soon as possible and then moved forward to the blue ball. I should have also moved forward to the goal as soon as I reached the blue ball.\n\n**Step 4: Outline the new path**\n\n1. Move forward to the green key.\n2. Move forward to the blue ball.\n3. Move forward to the goal.\n\n**Answer**: Move forward to the green key. Move forward to the blue ball.
