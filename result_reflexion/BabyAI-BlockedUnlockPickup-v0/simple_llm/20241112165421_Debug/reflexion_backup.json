   "To accomplish the task of picking up the box, I need to adjust my strategy to ensure I am not wasting turns. Instead of repeatedly trying to go forward when there is a wall, I should pick up the green key first, as it is an item I can collect in my forward direction. After picking up the green key, I can then turn to face west again and go forward until I reach the box. This will allow me to successfully pick up the box in fewer moves.",
   "To successfully pick up the box, I should prioritize collecting the green key located at (1, 4) as it will facilitate opening the green locked door at (5, 4) later. First, I need to turn right from my current position at (2, 1) to face north and then go forward to (3, 1). Next, I should continue moving forward to (4, 1), then turn right and go forward twice to reach (4, 4) where I can pick up the blue ball. After that, I can return to (3, 1), turn right to face east, and proceed to the first available route to the green key to collect it. Once I have the green key, I\u2019ll return to face west and continue toward the box until I can pick it up.",
   "To successfully pick up the box, I should have focused on a more efficient route. After moving to (4, 2), I should have turned right to face west, then immediately proceeded to (4, 1) and picked up the blue ball at (4, 4) before heading west to (4, 5) where I could have opened the green locked door. Following that, I should have moved forward to the right path towards the box. This way, I would avoid unnecessary turns and be more direct in reaching my goal."
