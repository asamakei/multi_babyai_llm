      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task of picking up the box, I need to adjust my strategy to ensure I am not wasting turns. Instead of repeatedly trying to go forward when there is a wall, I should pick up the green key first, as it is an item I can collect in my forward direction. After picking up the green key, I can then turn to face west again and go forward until I reach the box. This will allow me to successfully pick up the box in fewer moves.\nTrial 1:\nTo successfully pick up the box, I should prioritize collecting the green key located at (1, 4) as it will facilitate opening the green locked door at (5, 4) later. First, I need to turn right from my current position at (2, 1) to face north and then go forward to (3, 1). Next, I should continue moving forward to (4, 1), then turn right and go forward twice to reach (4, 4) where I can pick up the blue ball. After that, I can return to (3, 1), turn right to face east, and proceed to the first available route to the green key to collect it. Once I have the green key, I\u2019ll return to face west and continue toward the box until I can pick it up.\nTrial 2:\nTo successfully pick up the box, I should have focused on a more efficient route. After moving to (4, 2), I should have turned right to face west, then immediately proceeded to (4, 1) and picked up the blue ball at (4, 4) before heading west to (4, 5) where I could have opened the green locked door. Following that, I should have moved forward to the right path towards the box. This way, I would avoid unnecessary turns and be more direct in reaching my goal.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 0:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
