    "To accomplish the task of picking up the box, I need to adjust my strategy to ensure I am not wasting turns. Instead of repeatedly trying to go forward when there is a wall, I should pick up the green key first, as it is an item I can collect in my forward direction. After picking up the green key, I can then turn to face west again and go forward until I reach the box. This will allow me to successfully pick up the box in fewer moves."
