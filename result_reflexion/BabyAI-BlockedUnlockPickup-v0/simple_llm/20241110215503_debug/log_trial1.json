The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nMy plan is to move forward first, then turn right, and finally move forward again to reach the goal. I should have moved forward to the box instead of moving forward and then turning right, which led me to run out of time. I should have also turned right after moving forward to avoid getting stuck in the loop. With this new plan, I will be able to complete the task successfully.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\". You are facing north.
