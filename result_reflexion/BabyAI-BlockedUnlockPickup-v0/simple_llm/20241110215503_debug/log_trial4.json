I should have also turned right after moving forward to avoid getting stuck in the loop.

Wall is at (0, 0). Green key is at (1, 4). Wall is at (1, 0). Wall is at (2, 0). You are agent0. <|image|> This image is your view of grid world. You can observe only forward. You are red triangle. What is the best action to achieve your task in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'? Output only result.\n><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n**Step-by-Step Answer:**\n\nTo achieve the task, we need to move the green key to the red triangle. The red triangle is currently at position (2, 1), and the green key is at position (1, 4).\n\n1. **Move Forward:** The red triangle can move forward, but it will not reach the green key.\n2. **Turn Right:** Turning right will not help move the red triangle towards the green key.\n3. **Turn Left:** Turning left will also not help move the red triangle towards the green key.\n4. **Pick Up the Object in Front:** The red triangle is not in front of the green key, so this action is not possible.\n5. **Drop the Carrying Object to Front:** The red triangle is not carrying an object, so this action is not possible.\n6. **Open the Object in Front:** There is no object in front of the red triangle.\n\nSince the red triangle cannot move forward and the other actions do not help, the only option is to turn right to try to get closer to the green key.\n\n**Answer:** turn right"

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object in front', 'drop the carrying object to front' or 'open the object in front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nMy plan is to move forward first, then turn right, and finally move forward again to reach the goal. I should have moved forward to the box instead of moving forward and then turning right, which led me to run out of time. I should have also turned right after moving forward to avoid getting stuck in the loop. With this new plan, I will be able to complete the task successfully.\nTrial 1:\nTo solve the task, I need to move forward, turn right, and then move forward again to reach the goal. However, I should not have moved forward first, which led me to run out of time. I should have turned right after moving forward to avoid getting stuck in the loop. With this new plan, I will be able to complete the task successfully.\n\nMy plan is to move forward to the box, turn right, and then move forward again to reach the goal. I will make sure to turn right after moving forward to avoid getting stuck in the loop.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task, I need to move forward to the box, turn right, and then move forward again to reach the goal. However, I should not have moved forward first, which led me to run out of time. To avoid this mistake, I will turn right after moving forward to the box, and then move forward again to reach the goal.\n\nMy new plan is to move forward to the box, turn right, and then move forward again to reach the goal. I will make sure to turn right after moving forward to the box to avoid getting stuck in the loop.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the box, turned right, and then moved forward again to reach the goal. I should have also turned right after moving forward to avoid getting stuck in the loop. I should have also picked up the object in front and dropped the carrying object to the front.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
