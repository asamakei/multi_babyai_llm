   "To successfully pick up the box, I should prioritize my movement towards the green key at (1, 4) first. I will head north to (4, 3) and then to (4, 2), which will allow me to still face south and reach the key in subsequent moves. After obtaining the green key, I can return to (4, 4) to regroup with Agent1, and together we can unlock the green door at (5, 4) and then proceed to pick up the box. This way, I will avoid unnecessary delays and ensure I am positioned to quickly achieve the mission.",
   "I should prioritize moving directly towards Agent1 at (1, 4) instead of repeatedly trying to go forward without progressing. First, I will turn right to face west, then I will go forward to (1, 4) to meet with Agent1 quickly. Once together, we can then move to (5, 4) where the green door is located and use the green key to unlock it. This revised plan allows me to efficiently regroup with Agent1 and expedite our mission to pick up the box."

   "To successfully pick up the box, I should first go directly north to (1, 4) to pick up the green key. After acquiring the key, I will immediately head south to (4, 4) to meet Agent0. Together, we can open the green locked door at (5, 4) without any delays. Once the door is opened, we can retrieve the box. This plan focuses on minimizing unnecessary movements and maximizing coordination with Agent0 to complete the task efficiently.",
   "To successfully pick up the box, I should first turn left to face east and then go forward to (2, 4). From there, I can continue north towards (3, 4) and then (4, 4) where I will meet Agent0. After regrouping, we will move together to unlock the green door at (5, 4) using the green key I have. Once the door is open, we can quickly retrieve the box from (5, 4). This plan eliminates unnecessary movements and ensures prompt coordination with Agent0."
