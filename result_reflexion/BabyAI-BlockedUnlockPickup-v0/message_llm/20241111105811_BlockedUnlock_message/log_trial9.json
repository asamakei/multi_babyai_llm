      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object at my front', 'drop the carrying object to my front' or 'open the object at my front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\n\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\n\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\n\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object at my front', 'drop the carrying object to my front' or 'open the object at my front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\n\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\n\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\n\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Finally, I will move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\n\n**Answer:** Move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\nTrial 1:\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\nTrial 2:\nTo solve this task, I need to first move forward to the green square. Then, I should turn left and move forward to the red square. After that, I should turn right and move forward to the blue square. Finally, I should pick up the blue square and move forward to the goal.\n\n**My Previous Plan:**\n\n1. Move forward to the green square.\n2. Turn left and move forward to the red square.\n3. Move forward to the blue square.\n4. Pick up the blue square.\n5. Move forward to the goal.\n\n**My New Plan:**\n\n1. Move forward to the green square.\n2. Turn left and move forward to the red square.\n3. Turn right and move forward to the blue square.\n4. Pick up the blue square.\n5.

The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\\n\\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\\n\\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right.

The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\\n\\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\\n\\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\\n\\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\\n\\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column.

Move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\\nTrial 1:\\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\\n\\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\\nTrial 2:\\nTo solve this task, I need to first move forward to the green square. Then, I should turn left and move forward to the red square. After that, I should turn right and move forward to the blue square.
