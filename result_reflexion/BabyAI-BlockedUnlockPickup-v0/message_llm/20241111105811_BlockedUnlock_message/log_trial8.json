By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\nTrial 1:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\n\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\n\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\n\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Finally, I will move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\n\n**Answer:** Move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\nTrial 2:\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 0:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

Instead of moving forward, I should have turned left to avoid the obstacle and then moved forward to reach the goal. I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\\nTrial 1:\\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\\n\\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\\n\\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\\n\\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\\n\\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\\n\\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column.

Instead of moving forward, I should have turned left to avoid the obstacle and then moved forward to reach the goal. I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\nTrial 1:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\n\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\n\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right.

The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in \\'turn left\\', \\'turn right\\', \\'go forward\\', \\'pick up the object at my front\\', \\'drop the carrying object to my front\\' or \\'open the object at my front\\'.\\n\\nYour memory for the task below:\\nTrial 0:\\nTo complete the task, I should have taken a different path. Instead of moving forward, I should have turned left to avoid the obstacle and then moved forward to reach the goal. I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\\nTrial 1:\\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\\n\\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\\n\\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\\n\\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\\n\\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\\n\\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Finally, I will move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\\n\\n**Answer:** Move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\\nTrial 2:\\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\\n\\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\\nHere is the task:\\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\\ntime 6:\\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object at my front', 'drop the carrying object to my front' or 'open the object at my front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have taken a different path. Instead of moving forward, I should have turned left to avoid the obstacle and then moved forward to reach the goal. I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\nTrial 1:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\n\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\n\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\n\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Finally, I will move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\n\n**Answer:** Move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\nTrial 2:\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 7:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\\nTrial 1:\\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\\n\\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\\n\\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\\n\\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\\n\\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\\n\\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Finally, I will move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\\n\\n**Answer:** Move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\\nTrial 2:\\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\\n\\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\\nHere is the task:\\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\\ntime 7:\\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object at my front', 'drop the carrying object to my front' or 'open the object at my front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have taken a different path. Instead of moving forward, I should have turned left to avoid the obstacle and then moved forward to reach the goal. I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\nTrial 1:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\n\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\n\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\n\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Finally, I will move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\n\n**Answer:** Move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\nTrial 2:\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 8:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

Instead of moving forward, I should have turned left to avoid the obstacle and then moved forward to reach the goal. I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\nTrial 1:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\n\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\n\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\n\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Finally, I will move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\n\n**Answer:** Move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Move down to the third row and move right to the third column.

I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 9:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

Instead of moving forward, I should have turned left to avoid the obstacle and then moved forward to reach the goal. I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\nTrial 1:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\n\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\n\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\n\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column.

The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in \\'turn left\\', \\'turn right\\', \\'go forward\\', \\'pick up the object at my front\\', \\'drop the carrying object to my front\\' or \\'open the object at my front\\'.\\n\\nYour memory for the task below:\\nTrial 0:\\nTo complete the task, I should have taken a different path. Instead of moving forward, I should have turned left to avoid the obstacle and then moved forward to reach the goal. I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\\nTrial 1:\\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\\n\\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\\n\\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\\n\\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\\n\\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\\n\\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Finally, I will move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\\n\\n**Answer:** Move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\\nTrial 2:\\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\\n\\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\\nHere is the task:\\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\\ntime 10:\\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object at my front', 'drop the carrying object to my front' or 'open the object at my front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have taken a different path. Instead of moving forward, I should have turned left to avoid the obstacle and then moved forward to reach the goal. I should have also taken a more direct route to the goal by moving east and then south instead of moving north and then east. By doing so, I would have had enough time to complete the task.\nTrial 1:\n**Step 1: Analyze the situation.**\n\nThe environment is a grid world with a red triangle and a green square. The red triangle is at the top-left corner, and the green square is at the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the necessary actions.**\n\nTo reach the green square, I need to move down and right. However, I must avoid the wall in the middle of the grid.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the plan.**\n\nI will move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Then, I will move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Finally, I will move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\n\n**Answer:** Move down to the second row, then move right to the second column. Move down to the third row and move right to the third column. Move down to the fourth row and move right to the fourth column.\nTrial 2:\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 13:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
