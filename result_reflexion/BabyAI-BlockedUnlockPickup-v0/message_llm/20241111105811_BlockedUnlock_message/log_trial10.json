      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object at my front', 'drop the carrying object to my front' or 'open the object at my front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo succeed in the task, I need to analyze the environment and devise a new plan of action. I should have started by moving forward to the green square, then turned left and moved forward to the red triangle. Next, I should have turned right and moved forward to the green square, and finally, I should have turned left and moved forward to the green square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the red triangle, turn right and move forward to the green square, turn left and move forward to the green square.\nTrial 1:\nTo solve this task, I need to first move forward to the green square. Then, I should turn left and move forward to the red square. After that, I should turn right and move forward to the blue square.

The green square is located at the top of the grid, and the red square is located to the right of the green square.\n\nThe possible actions are:\n\n*   Turn left\n*   Turn right\n*   Go forward\n*   Pick up the object at my front\n*   Drop the carrying object to my front\n*   Open the object at my front\n\nSince the agent needs to move forward to the green square, the best action is to go forward. This will move the agent to the top of the grid.\n\nAfter moving forward, the agent needs to turn left to face the red square. The best action is to turn left.\n\nFinally, the agent needs to move forward to the red square. The best action is to go forward.\n\nTherefore, the best sequence of actions is:\n\n1.  Go forward\n2.

The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object at my front', 'drop the carrying object to my front' or 'open the object at my front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will first move forward to reach the red square. Next, I will turn left and move forward to reach the green square. Then, I will pick up the green square and move forward to reach the blue square. Finally, I will drop the green square and turn right to move forward to the blue square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward. Turn left. Pick up the green square. Move forward. Drop the green square. Turn right. Move forward.\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the task, I will move forward to the green square. Then, I will pick up the green square. Next, I will move forward to the red square. After that, I will pick up the red square. Finally, I will drop the red square.\nTrial 2:\n**Analysis of the Situation**\n\nThe image shows a grid world with a green triangle, red square, blue circle, and a key. The goal is to pick up the key and move it to the target location.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Location**\n\nThe key is located at (1,4).\n\n**Step 2: Plan the Route**\n\nTo reach the key, I will move the green triangle to the location above the key, then move it to the location next to the key, and finally move it to the target location.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the Plan**\n\nI will move the green triangle to the location above the key, then move it to the location next to the key, and finally move it to the target location.\n\n**Answer:** Move the green triangle to the location above the key, then move it to the location next to the key, and finally move it to the target location.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 18:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
