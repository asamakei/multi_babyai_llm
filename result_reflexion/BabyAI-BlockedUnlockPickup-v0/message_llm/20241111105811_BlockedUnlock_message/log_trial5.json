Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object at my front', 'drop the carrying object to my front' or 'open the object at my front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will first move forward to reach the green square. Then, I will turn left and move forward to reach the blue square. I will pick up the green square and move forward to the blue square. Finally, I will drop the green square and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue square.\nTrial 1:\n**Revised Plan of Action:**\n\nTo complete the task, I will first turn right and move forward to reach the green key. I will then pick up the green key and turn left. After that, I will move forward to reach the blue ball. Finally, I will drop the green key and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Specific Actions:**\n\n1. Turn right and move forward to reach the green key.\n2. Pick up the green key.\n3. Turn left and move forward to reach the blue ball.\n4. Drop the green key.\n5. Turn right and move forward to pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Environment-Specific Actions:**\n\n*   To avoid running out of time, I will move quickly to the green key and then to the blue ball.\n*   I will prioritize picking up the green key and the blue ball over moving forward.\n*   I will drop the green key before picking up the blue ball to avoid any potential conflicts.\n\nBy following this revised plan of action, I will be able to complete the task within the given time limit.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the Situation**\n\nThe image shows a grid world with a red square at (3, 2). The goal is to move forward to reach the red square, pick it up, and then move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Actions**\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to take the following actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the Actions**\n\nLet's execute the actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square: Move forward 2 units to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square: Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square: Move forward 2 units to reach the blue square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward 2 units.

Then, I will turn left and move forward to reach the blue square. I will pick up the green square and move forward to the blue square. Finally, I will drop the green square and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue square.\nTrial 1:\n**Revised Plan of Action:**\n\nTo complete the task, I will first turn right and move forward to reach the green key. I will then pick up the green key and turn left. After that, I will move forward to reach the blue ball. Finally, I will drop the green key and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Specific Actions:**\n\n1. Turn right and move forward to reach the green key.\n2. Pick up the green key.\n3. Turn left and move forward to reach the blue ball.\n4. Drop the green key.\n5. Turn right and move forward to pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Environment-Specific Actions:**\n\n*   To avoid running out of time, I will move quickly to the green key and then to the blue ball.\n*   I will prioritize picking up the green key and the blue ball over moving forward.\n*   I will drop the green key before picking up the blue ball to avoid any potential conflicts.\n\nBy following this revised plan of action, I will be able to complete the task within the given time limit.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the Situation**\n\nThe image shows a grid world with a red square at (3, 2). The goal is to move forward to reach the red square, pick it up, and then move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Actions**\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to take the following actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the Actions**\n\nLet's execute the actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square: Move forward 2 units to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square: Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square: Move forward 2 units to reach the blue square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward 2 units.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The position (0,0) is at the northwest end. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the object at my front', 'drop the carrying object to my front' or 'open the object at my front'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I will first move forward to reach the green square. Then, I will turn left and move forward to reach the blue square. I will pick up the green square and move forward to the blue square. Finally, I will drop the green square and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue square.\nTrial 1:\n**Revised Plan of Action:**\n\nTo complete the task, I will first turn right and move forward to reach the green key. I will then pick up the green key and turn left. After that, I will move forward to reach the blue ball. Finally, I will drop the green key and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Specific Actions:**\n\n1. Turn right and move forward to reach the green key.\n2. Pick up the green key.\n3. Turn left and move forward to reach the blue ball.\n4. Drop the green key.\n5. Turn right and move forward to pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Environment-Specific Actions:**\n\n*   To avoid running out of time, I will move quickly to the green key and then to the blue ball.\n*   I will prioritize picking up the green key and the blue ball over moving forward.\n*   I will drop the green key before picking up the blue ball to avoid any potential conflicts.\n\nBy following this revised plan of action, I will be able to complete the task within the given time limit.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the Situation**\n\nThe image shows a grid world with a red square at (3, 2). The goal is to move forward to reach the red square, pick it up, and then move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Actions**\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to take the following actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the Actions**\n\nLet's execute the actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square: Move forward 2 units to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square: Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square: Move forward 2 units to reach the blue square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward 2 units.

Then, I will turn left and move forward to reach the blue square. I will pick up the green square and move forward to the blue square. Finally, I will drop the green square and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue square.\nTrial 1:\n**Revised Plan of Action:**\n\nTo complete the task, I will first turn right and move forward to reach the green key. I will then pick up the green key and turn left. After that, I will move forward to reach the blue ball. Finally, I will drop the green key and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Specific Actions:**\n\n1. Turn right and move forward to reach the green key.\n2. Pick up the green key.\n3. Turn left and move forward to reach the blue ball.\n4. Drop the green key.\n5. Turn right and move forward to pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Environment-Specific Actions:**\n\n*   To avoid running out of time, I will move quickly to the green key and then to the blue ball.\n*   I will prioritize picking up the green key and the blue ball over moving forward.\n*   I will drop the green key before picking up the blue ball to avoid any potential conflicts.\n\nBy following this revised plan of action, I will be able to complete the task within the given time limit.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the Situation**\n\nThe image shows a grid world with a red square at (3, 2). The goal is to move forward to reach the red square, pick it up, and then move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Actions**\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to take the following actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the Actions**\n\nLet's execute the actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square: Move forward 2 units to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square: Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square: Move forward 2 units to reach the blue square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward 2 units.

Turn right and move forward to pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Environment-Specific Actions:**\n\n*   To avoid running out of time, I will move quickly to the green key and then to the blue ball.\n*   I will prioritize picking up the green key and the blue ball over moving forward.\n*   I will drop the green key before picking up the blue ball to avoid any potential conflicts.\n\nBy following this revised plan of action, I will be able to complete the task within the given time limit.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the Situation**\n\nThe image shows a grid world with a red square at (3, 2). The goal is to move forward to reach the red square, pick it up, and then move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Actions**\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to take the following actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the Actions**\n\nLet's execute the actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square: Move forward 2 units to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square: Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square: Move forward 2 units to reach the blue square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward 2 units. Pick up the red square. Move forward 2 units.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 19:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\". You are facing south. You are at (3, 4).

Then, I will turn left and move forward to reach the blue square. I will pick up the green square and move forward to the blue square. Finally, I will drop the green square and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue square.\nTrial 1:\n**Revised Plan of Action:**\n\nTo complete the task, I will first turn right and move forward to reach the green key. I will then pick up the green key and turn left. After that, I will move forward to reach the blue ball. Finally, I will drop the green key and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Specific Actions:**\n\n1. Turn right and move forward to reach the green key.\n2. Pick up the green key.\n3. Turn left and move forward to reach the blue ball.\n4. Drop the green key.\n5. Turn right and move forward to pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Environment-Specific Actions:**\n\n*   To avoid running out of time, I will move quickly to the green key and then to the blue ball.\n*   I will prioritize picking up the green key and the blue ball over moving forward.\n*   I will drop the green key before picking up the blue ball to avoid any potential conflicts.\n\nBy following this revised plan of action, I will be able to complete the task within the given time limit.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the Situation**\n\nThe image shows a grid world with a red square at (3, 2). The goal is to move forward to reach the red square, pick it up, and then move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Actions**\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to take the following actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the Actions**\n\nLet's execute the actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square: Move forward 2 units to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square: Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square: Move forward 2 units to reach the blue square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward 2 units.

Then, I will turn left and move forward to reach the blue square. I will pick up the green square and move forward to the blue square. Finally, I will drop the green square and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue square.\nTrial 1:\n**Revised Plan of Action:**\n\nTo complete the task, I will first turn right and move forward to reach the green key. I will then pick up the green key and turn left. After that, I will move forward to reach the blue ball. Finally, I will drop the green key and turn right to move forward and pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Specific Actions:**\n\n1. Turn right and move forward to reach the green key.\n2. Pick up the green key.\n3. Turn left and move forward to reach the blue ball.\n4. Drop the green key.\n5. Turn right and move forward to pick up the blue ball.\n\n**Environment-Specific Actions:**\n\n*   To avoid running out of time, I will move quickly to the green key and then to the blue ball.\n*   I will prioritize picking up the green key and the blue ball over moving forward.\n*   I will drop the green key before picking up the blue ball to avoid any potential conflicts.\n\nBy following this revised plan of action, I will be able to complete the task within the given time limit.\nTrial 2:\n**Step 1: Analyze the Situation**\n\nThe image shows a grid world with a red square at (3, 2). The goal is to move forward to reach the red square, pick it up, and then move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Actions**\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to take the following actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square.\n\n**Step 3: Execute the Actions**\n\nLet's execute the actions:\n\n* Move forward to reach the red square: Move forward 2 units to reach the red square.\n* Pick up the red square: Pick up the red square.\n* Move forward to reach the blue square: Move forward 2 units to reach the blue square.\n\n**Answer:** Move forward 2 units.
