    "In my previous attempt, I failed to complete the task within the given time limit. Upon reflection, I realize that I should have focused on navigating through the walls and obstacles more efficiently, rather than getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. A more effective approach would have been to prioritize finding the shortest path to the exit while also collecting the blue ball and the green key. To achieve this, I should have moved east towards the blue ball as soon as possible, then turned north and moved forward to the green key, and finally unlocked the green locked door to reach the exit."

    "After re-examining my previous experience, I realized that I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the box. A more effective plan would be to have Agent1 move to the position 1 step right of the wall in 3 steps left and 2 steps right, then have Agent1 turn around and face north, and finally have Agent1 move north until they are in front of the box. Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to pick up the box, rather than moving forward myself. This would have allowed us to complete the task more efficiently and avoid the time constraint."
