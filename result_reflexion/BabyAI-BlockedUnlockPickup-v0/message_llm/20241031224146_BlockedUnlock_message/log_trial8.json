A more effective plan would be to have Agent1 move to the position 1 step right of the wall in 3 steps left and 2 steps right, then have Agent1 turn around and face north, and finally have Agent1 move north until they are in front of the box. Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to pick up the box, rather than moving forward myself. I should have also considered the locked door and moved north to the locked door before proceeding to the exit.\nTrial 1:\nIn my previous experience, I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the exit.

I should have also moved more efficiently by taking advantage of the grid structure to reach the blue ball and the green key in fewer steps. My revised plan is to move east to position myself in front of the green locked door, then turn around and face east to unlock the door, and finally move east to reach the blue ball.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I failed to complete the task within the given time limit because I didn't prioritize finding the shortest path to the exit while collecting the blue ball and the green key. A more effective approach would have been to move east towards the blue ball as soon as possible, then turn north and move forward to the green key, and finally unlock the green locked door to reach the exit. To improve my strategy, I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. My revised plan is to move east to position myself in front of the green locked door, then turn around and face east to unlock the door, and finally move east to reach the exit.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

To improve my strategy, I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. I should have also moved more efficiently by taking advantage of the grid structure to reach the blue ball and the green key in fewer steps. My revised plan is to move east to position myself in front of the green locked door, then turn around and face east to unlock the door, and finally move east to reach the blue ball.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reviewing my past experience, I realize that I failed to complete the task within the given time limit because I didn't prioritize finding the shortest path to the exit while collecting the blue ball and the green key. A more effective approach would have been to move east towards the blue ball as soon as possible, then turn north and move forward to the green key, and finally unlock the green locked door to reach the exit.

A more effective plan would be to have Agent1 move to the position 1 step right of the wall in 3 steps left and 2 steps right, then have Agent1 turn around and face north, and finally have Agent1 move north until they are in front of the box. Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to pick up the box, rather than moving forward myself. I should have also considered the locked door and moved north to the locked door before proceeding to the exit.\nTrial 1:\nIn my previous experience, I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the exit.

This would have allowed us to complete the task more efficiently and avoid the time constraint.\nTrial 2:\nIn my previous experience, I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the box. A more effective plan would be to have Agent1 move to the position 1 step right of the wall in 3 steps left and 2 steps right, then have Agent1 turn around and face north, and finally have Agent1 move north until they are in front of the box. Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to pick up the box, rather than moving forward myself. I should have also considered the locked door and moved north to the locked door before proceeding to the exit.\nTrial 3:\nIn my previous experience, I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the box.
