  "agent0:To achieve the mission \"pick up the box\" as soon as possible, I should work with agent1 to navigate through the grid world environment efficiently. I should move east towards the blue ball as soon as possible, then turn north and move forward to the green key, and finally unlock the green locked door to reach the exit. I should also consider the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. My revised plan is to move north to the locked door, then east to the exit, and finally pick up the box, making sure to avoid the obstacles and walls along the way. I should communicate with agent1 to ensure a coordinated effort in navigating through the grid world.",
