My revised plan is to move east to position myself in front of the locked door, then turn around and face east to unlock it, and finally move east to the exit, making sure to navigate around the walls and obstacles in the most efficient way possible.\nTrial 3:\nIn my previous attempt, I failed to complete the task within the given time limit because I didn't prioritize finding the shortest path to the box while navigating through the grid. A more effective approach would have been to move east to position myself in front of the box as soon as possible, then turn around and face east to pick it up. To improve my strategy, I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right.

A more effective approach would have been to move east to position myself in front of the green locked door, then turn around and face east to unlock the door, and finally move east to reach the exit. I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right.

A more effective plan would be to have Agent1 move to the position 1 step right of the wall in 3 steps left and 2 steps right, then have Agent1 turn around and face north, and finally have Agent1 move north until they are in front of the box. Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to pick up the box, rather than moving forward myself. To avoid running out of time, I should have instructed Agent1 to unlock the locked door before moving east to the exit.\nTrial 1:\nIn my previous experience, I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the box.

A more effective plan would be to have Agent1 move to the position 1 step right of the wall in 3 steps left and 2 steps right, then have Agent1 turn around and face north, and finally have Agent1 move north until they are in front of the box. Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to pick up the box, rather than moving forward myself. I should also have considered the locked door and moved north to the locked door before proceeding to the exit.\nTrial 4:\nIn my previous experience, I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the box.

To improve my strategy, I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. My revised plan is to move east to position myself in front of the box, then turn around and face east to pick it up, making sure to navigate around the walls and obstacles in the most efficient way possible.\nTrial 1:\nIn my previous attempt, I failed to complete the task within the given time limit because I didn't prioritize finding the shortest path to the box while navigating through the grid.

To improve my strategy, I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. My revised plan is to move east to position myself in front of the box, then turn around and face east to pick it up, making sure to navigate around the walls and obstacles in the most efficient way possible.\nTrial 1:\nIn my previous attempt, I failed to complete the task within the given time limit because I didn't prioritize finding the shortest path to the box while navigating through the grid.

Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to pick up the box, rather than moving forward myself. To avoid running out of time, I should have instructed Agent1 to unlock the locked door before moving east to the exit.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".

To improve my strategy, I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. My revised plan is to move east to position myself in front of the box, then turn around and face east to pick it up, making sure to navigate around the walls and obstacles in the most efficient way possible.\nTrial 1:\nIn my previous attempt, I failed to complete the task within the given time limit because I didn't prioritize finding the shortest path to the box while navigating through the grid.

A more effective approach would have been to move east to position myself in front of the box as soon as possible, then turn around and face east to pick it up. To improve my strategy, I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. My revised plan is to move east to position myself in front of the box, then turn around and face east to pick it up, making sure to navigate around the walls and obstacles in the most efficient way possible.\nTrial 1:\nIn my previous attempt, I failed to complete the task within the given time limit because I didn't prioritize finding the shortest path to the box while navigating through the grid.

A more effective approach would have been to move east to position myself in front of the box as soon as possible, then turn around and face east to pick it up. To improve my strategy, I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. My revised plan is to move east to position myself in front of the box, then turn around and face east to pick it up, making sure to navigate around the walls and obstacles in the most efficient way possible."

    "In my previous experience, I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the box. A more effective plan would be to have Agent1 move to the position 1 step right of the wall in 3 steps left and 2 steps right, then have Agent1 turn around and face north, and finally have Agent1 move north until they are in front of the box. Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to pick up the box, rather than moving forward myself. I should have also considered the locked door and moved north to the locked door before proceeding to the exit. To avoid running out of time, I should have instructed Agent1 to unlock the locked door before moving east to the exit.",
