  "In my previous experience, I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the exit. A more effective plan would be to have Agent1 move to the position 1 step right of the wall in 3 steps left and 2 steps right, then have Agent1 turn around and face north, and finally have Agent1 move north until they are in front of the exit. Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to unlock the exit, rather than moving forward myself. To avoid running out of time, I should have instructed Agent1 to unlock the locked door before moving east to the exit.",
