A more effective approach would have been to move east towards the blue ball as soon as possible, then turn north and move forward to the green key, and finally unlock the green locked door to reach the exit. I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right.

  "In my previous experience, I failed to complete the task due to not properly coordinating with Agent1 to reach the exit. A more effective plan would be to have Agent1 move to the position 1 step right of the wall in 3 steps left and 2 steps right, then have Agent1 turn around and face north, and finally have Agent1 move north until they are in front of the exit. Once Agent1 is in position, I should have instructed them to unlock the exit, rather than moving forward myself. This would have allowed us to complete the task more efficiently and avoid the time constraint.",
