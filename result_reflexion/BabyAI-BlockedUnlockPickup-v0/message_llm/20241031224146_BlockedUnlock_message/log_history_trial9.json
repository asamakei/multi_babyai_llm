  "In my previous attempt, I failed to complete the task within the given time limit because I didn't prioritize finding the shortest path to the exit while collecting the blue ball and the green key. A more effective approach would have been to move east towards the blue ball as soon as possible, then turn north and move forward to the green key, and finally unlock the green locked door to reach the exit. To improve my strategy, I should have also considered the obstacles and walls in the environment to avoid getting stuck in a loop of moving forward and turning left/right. My revised plan is to move north to the locked door, then east to the exit, and finally pick up the box, making sure to avoid the obstacles and walls along the way. I should have also moved more efficiently by taking advantage of the grid structure to reach the blue ball and the green key in fewer steps.",
