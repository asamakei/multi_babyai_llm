    "The task is to pick up the ball as quickly as possible. The mistake in the previous attempt was running out of time, which was due to taking too many steps in the wrong direction. A new plan of action should involve moving east towards the ball while avoiding the walls and taking the shortest path to the goal.\n\nTo achieve this, the agent should move east as soon as it reaches the first row, then turn north to reach the ball. It should then move east again to reach the goal. This plan should be followed without any deviations to ensure the task is completed within the given time limit."
