   "The task is to pick up the ball as quickly as possible. The mistake in the previous attempt was running out of time, which was due to taking too many steps in the wrong direction. A new plan of action should involve moving east towards the ball while avoiding the walls and taking the shortest path to the goal.\n\nTo achieve this, the agent should move east as soon as it reaches the first row, then turn north to reach the ball. It should then move east again to reach the goal. This plan should be followed without any deviations to ensure the task is completed within the given time limit.",
   "To avoid running out of time, I should have prioritized moving east to reach the ball as soon as possible. I should have turned north to navigate to the ball more efficiently. Additionally, I should have taken a more direct path to the goal, avoiding unnecessary movements that wasted time. By doing so, I could have completed the task within the time limit.",

I should have moved east immediately after reaching the first row, then turned north to reach the ball, and finally moved east to the goal. This approach would have saved time and allowed me to complete the task within the given time limit.\n\nMy new plan of action should involve:\n\n1. Moving east as soon as I reach the first row.\n2. Turning north to reach the ball.\n3. Moving east to the goal.\n\nBy following this plan, I can avoid unnecessary movements and ensure that I complete the task within the time limit."
