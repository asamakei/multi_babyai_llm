Next time, I will prioritize turning left when encountering a wall to increase my chances of finding the ball quickly.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time navigating through the grid world without a clear plan to pick up the ball.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time navigating through the grid world without a clear plan to pick up the ball. My new plan is to move forward and explore the environment more efficiently, using the wall detection to my advantage. Specifically, I should have turned left when I hit the wall instead of going forward, which would have led me to the ball sooner. Next time, I will prioritize turning left when encountering a wall to increase my chances of finding the ball quickly.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time navigating through the grid world without a clear plan to pick up the ball.

My new plan is to move forward and explore the environment more efficiently, using the wall detection to my advantage. Specifically, I should have turned left when I hit the wall instead of going forward, which would have led me to the ball sooner. Next time, I will prioritize turning left when encountering a wall to increase my chances of finding the ball quickly.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time navigating through the grid world without a clear plan to pick up the ball.
