  "To complete the task of picking up the ball, I plan to move south to reunite with Agent1 and then explore the area together to locate the ball. I will avoid moving north and east prematurely, as this led to wasted time in my previous attempt. Instead, I will focus on reuniting with Agent1 and then methodically searching the area to find the ball, ensuring we don't miss any potential paths. By working together and searching the area systematically, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.",

We will then move south together to cover the lower part of the grid, and once we reach the bottom, we will move east and west simultaneously to cover the entire width of the grid. This will ensure that we don't miss the ball and can complete the task efficiently. By working together and searching the area systematically, I aim to avoid running out of time and successfully complete the task.",
