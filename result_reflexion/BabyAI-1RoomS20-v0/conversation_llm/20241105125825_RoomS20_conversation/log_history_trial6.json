  "My previous plan was to move north with Agent1 to find the origin, but I didn't consider exploring the area to the east to find the ball. To correct this, I plan to move east after reaching the wall to the north, and then explore the area to find the ball. I will also keep an eye on Agent1's position to ensure we're not missing any potential paths to the ball. By doing so, I hope to avoid running out of time and successfully complete the task.",
  "Trial 1:",
  "My previous plan was to move north and then east to find the ball, but I didn't consider reuniting with Agent1 before heading back to the starting point. To correct this, I plan to move south to reunite with Agent1 immediately after picking up the ball, and then explore the area together to see if there's anything else we need to accomplish. This will ensure we don't waste time and can work together to complete any additional tasks.",
  "Trial 2:",
  "To complete the task of picking up the ball, I plan to move south to reunite with Agent1 and then explore the area together to locate the ball. I will avoid moving north and east prematurely, as this led to wasted time in my previous attempt. Instead, I will focus on reuniting with Agent1 and then methodically searching the area to find the ball, ensuring we don't miss any potential paths. By working together and searching the area systematically, I aim to complete the task efficiently and avoid running out of time.",
