    "My previous plan was to move north with Agent1 to find the origin, but I didn't consider exploring the area to the east to find the ball. To correct this, I plan to move east after reaching the wall to the north, and then explore the area to find the ball. I will also keep an eye on Agent1's position to ensure we're not missing any potential paths to the ball. By doing so, I hope to avoid running out of time and successfully complete the task."

    "Upon reflection, I realize that I spent too much time moving north with Agent1 without exploring the surroundings thoroughly. A new plan of action would be to turn left and head east earlier, exploring the area to locate the ball, rather than solely focusing on reaching the origin. I should have also communicated with Agent0 to split up and cover more ground, increasing our chances of finding the ball. By doing so, we could have potentially found the ball and completed the mission more efficiently."
