A new plan of action would be to turn left and head east earlier, exploring the area to locate the ball, rather than solely focusing on reaching the origin. I should have also communicated with Agent0 to split up and cover more ground, increasing our chances of finding the ball. By doing so, we could have potentially found the ball and completed the mission more efficiently.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\".

Agent0 facing east is in 2 steps east and 10 steps north.\nagent0:\"Let's move north to find the origin first, then we can explore the area to the east to find the ball. I'll take the lead and move north, you follow and keep an eye out for any obstacles or potential paths to the ball.\"\nagent1:\"I agree to follow you north, but I also think we should split up and cover more ground once we reach the origin, increasing our chances of finding the ball. Why don't we meet back at the origin and then split up to explore the area to the east? That way, we can cover more area and potentially find the ball faster.\"\nagent0:\"I agree with your plan to split up and cover more ground once we reach the origin. Let's meet back at the origin and then you can move east while I move northeast to explore the area. This way, we can cover more area and potentially find the ball faster.\"\nagent1:\"Sounds like a solid plan, I'll follow you north and we can meet back at the origin to split up and explore the area to the east. Once we reach the origin, I'll head east while you move northeast, and we can communicate if either of us finds the ball.\"\n> turn left\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\". You are facing south.

To correct this, I plan to move east after reaching the wall to the north, and then explore the area to find the ball. I will also keep an eye on Agent1's position to ensure we're not missing any potential paths to the ball. By doing so, I hope to avoid running out of time and successfully complete the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\".

To correct this, I plan to move east after reaching the wall to the north, and then explore the area to find the ball. I will also keep an eye on Agent1's position to ensure we're not missing any potential paths to the ball. By doing so, I hope to avoid running out of time and successfully complete the task.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\".
