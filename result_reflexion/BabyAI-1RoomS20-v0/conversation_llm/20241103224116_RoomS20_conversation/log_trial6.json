My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have moved forward and turned left earlier to align myself with the ball, instead of repeatedly trying to pick it up without proper alignment. My new plan is to move forward until I am close to the ball, then turn left to face the ball, and finally pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not aligning myself with the ball before attempting to pick it up.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going in different directions and not reaching the ball. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner. I should also reassess my surroundings after each step to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\".

My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have moved forward and turned left earlier to align myself with the ball, instead of repeatedly trying to pick it up without proper alignment. My new plan is to move forward until I am close to the ball, then turn left to face the ball, and finally pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not aligning myself with the ball before attempting to pick it up.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going in different directions and not reaching the ball. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.

This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have moved forward and turned left earlier to align myself with the ball, instead of repeatedly trying to pick it up without proper alignment. My new plan is to move forward until I am close to the ball, then turn left to face the ball, and finally pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not aligning myself with the ball before attempting to pick it up.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going in different directions and not reaching the ball. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.

My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have moved forward and turned left earlier to align myself with the ball, instead of repeatedly trying to pick it up without proper alignment. My new plan is to move forward until I am close to the ball, then turn left to face the ball, and finally pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not aligning myself with the ball before attempting to pick it up.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going in different directions and not reaching the ball. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner. I should also reassess my surroundings after each step to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\".

My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going forward and hitting the wall multiple times. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left earlier and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going forward and hitting the wall multiple times. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have moved forward and turned left earlier to align myself with the ball, instead of repeatedly trying to pick it up without proper alignment. My new plan is to move forward until I am close to the ball, then turn left to face the ball, and finally pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not aligning myself with the ball before attempting to pick it up.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going in different directions and not reaching the ball. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner. I should also reassess my surroundings after each step to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\".

My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going forward and hitting the wall multiple times. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left earlier and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going forward and hitting the wall multiple times. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner.\nTrial 3:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have moved forward and turned left earlier to align myself with the ball, instead of repeatedly trying to pick it up without proper alignment. My new plan is to move forward until I am close to the ball, then turn left to face the ball, and finally pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not aligning myself with the ball before attempting to pick it up.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned left and moved forward to reach the ball instead of going in different directions and not reaching the ball. My new plan is to turn left and move forward to reach the ball, then pick it up. This plan accounts for my mistake of not turning left and moving forward to reach the ball in a timely manner. I should also reassess my surroundings after each step to ensure I'm on the correct path.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\".
