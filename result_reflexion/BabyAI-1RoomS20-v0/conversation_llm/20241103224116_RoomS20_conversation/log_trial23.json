Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to turn right immediately after starting and move forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. Then, I should move forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations. By doing so, I should be able to pick up the ball efficiently and complete the mission within the given time frame.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 3:\nMy new plan is to turn right immediately after starting and move forward for 3 steps to align myself with the ball's location, then move forward 1 more step to reach the ball. I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. Additionally, I should have moved right immediately after starting to avoid the walls in front of me.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to turn right immediately after starting and move forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time.

This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 3:\nMy new plan is to turn right immediately after starting and move forward for 3 steps to align myself with the ball's location, then move forward 1 more step to reach the ball. I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. Additionally, I should have moved right immediately after starting to avoid the walls in front of me.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.

My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 3:\nMy new plan is to turn right immediately after starting and move forward for 3 steps to align myself with the ball's location, then move forward 1 more step to reach the ball. I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time.

By doing so, I should be able to pick up the ball efficiently and complete the mission within the given time frame.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 3:\nMy new plan is to turn right immediately after starting and move forward for 3 steps to align myself with the ball's location, then move forward 1 more step to reach the ball. I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. Additionally, I should have moved right immediately after starting to avoid the walls in front of me.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations. Additionally, I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\".

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to turn right immediately after starting and move forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time.

This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 3:\nMy new plan is to turn right immediately after starting and move forward for 3 steps to align myself with the ball's location, then move forward 1 more step to reach the ball. I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. Additionally, I should have moved right immediately after starting to avoid the walls in front of me.\nTrial 4:\nTo complete the task of picking up the ball, I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time.
