This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball.

This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball.

Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. This approach would have allowed me to reach the ball more efficiently and avoid the unnecessary back-and-forth movements that led to the failure.\nTrial 1:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball. However, I should have also paid closer attention to the wall locations and adjusted my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 2:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have turned right immediately after starting and moved forward for 13 steps to align myself with the ball's location. Then, I should have moved forward 6 more steps to reach the ball, while paying closer attention to the wall locations and adjusting my steps accordingly to avoid running out of time. My new plan is to turn right, move forward 13 steps while avoiding the walls, and then move forward 6 more steps to pick up the ball, making sure to adjust my steps to account for the wall locations.\nTrial 3:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up. My new plan is to turn right to face south, then move left to align with the ball, and finally move forward to pick up the ball. This approach will allow me to efficiently reach the ball and accomplish my mission.\nTrial 4:\nUpon reflection, I realize that I should have moved left immediately after turning right to align myself with the ball, and then moved forward to pick it up.
