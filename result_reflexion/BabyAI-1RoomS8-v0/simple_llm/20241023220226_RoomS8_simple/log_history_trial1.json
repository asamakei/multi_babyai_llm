  "Based on the given history, my previous plan involved moving forward repeatedly without considering the optimal path to the yellow ball. I should have taken a more strategic approach by analyzing the environment and identifying the shortest path to the ball. A revised plan would involve carefully navigating through the grid world by turning left or right when necessary to avoid the walls and move towards the yellow ball. I should have also considered the relative position of the walls and the ball to determine the most efficient route. A revised plan would be to turn left and then move forward to avoid the wall at 5 steps forward and 2 steps left, and then proceed to the yellow ball.",
