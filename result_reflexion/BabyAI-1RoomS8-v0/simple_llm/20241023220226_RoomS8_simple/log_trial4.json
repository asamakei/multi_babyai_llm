A revised plan would involve turning right after reaching the first wall to avoid it, then proceeding to move forward and turning left to adjust my direction towards the ball. I should have also navigated through the grid world by carefully avoiding the walls and taking a more efficient route. To achieve this, I should have turned right after the first wall to move in the opposite direction, then proceeded to move forward and turned left to adjust my direction towards the ball.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nYour mission is \"pick up the ball\".

I should have taken a more strategic approach by analyzing the environment and identifying the shortest path to the ball. A revised plan would involve carefully navigating through the grid world by turning left or right when necessary to avoid the walls and move towards the yellow ball. To achieve this, I should have turned left after reaching the first wall to avoid it, then proceeded to move forward and turned right to adjust my direction towards the ball.\nTrial 1:\nBased on the given history, my previous plan involved moving forward repeatedly without considering the optimal path to the yellow ball.

I should have also navigated through the grid world by carefully avoiding the walls and taking a more efficient route. To achieve this, I should have turned right after the first wall to move in the opposite direction, then proceeded to move forward and turned left to adjust my direction towards the ball.\nTrial 2:\nBased on the given history, my previous plan involved moving forward repeatedly without considering the optimal path to the yellow ball.
