Upon starting, I should have moved south to reach the box's location, instead of turning left and right multiple times. Specifically, I should have turned right at time 11 and gone forward to reach the box, avoiding the unnecessary turns and backtracking. This would have saved time and allowed me to complete the task before running out of time."
