      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (12, 0) is northeast, (0, 12) is southwest, (12, 12) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have turned left at time 45 and gone through the yellow closed door at (10, 4) instead of turning left and right multiple times.
