   "To complete the task, I should have met Agent1 at (8, 5) and then moved east together to search for the box. I should have avoided going back and forth between the same locations and instead focused on exploring the eastern part of the grid with Agent1. By doing so, we could have potentially found the box and completed the mission before running out of time.",
   "To complete the task, I should have moved east with Agent1 to explore the area and search for the box, but also kept an eye out for any obstacles or doors that we needed to navigate. I should have avoided getting stuck in the southern area and instead focused on exploring the eastern and western parts of the grid with Agent1. I should have also checked the yellow open door at (6, 8) earlier and explored the area it led to, potentially finding the box and completing the mission before running out of time."

   "I should have turned right and gone forward to reach (8, 6) earlier, instead of turning left and right multiple times. Then, I should have gone forward again to reach the wall at (8, 6) and turned left to face east. From there, I should have gone forward to explore the eastern area and search for the box, instead of going back and forth.",
   "To complete the task of picking up the box, I should have explored the western area more thoroughly and examined the grey closed door at (4, 11) earlier. I should have also gone through the yellow open door at (6, 8) to access new areas and potential clues. Additionally, I should have moved south from (7, 7) to explore the area below the wall and potentially find the box or another path."
