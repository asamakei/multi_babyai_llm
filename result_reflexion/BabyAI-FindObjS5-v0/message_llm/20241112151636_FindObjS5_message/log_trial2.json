Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI should have turned right and gone forward to reach (8, 6) earlier, instead of turning left and right multiple times. Then, I should have gone forward again to reach the wall at (8, 6) and turned left to face east. From there, I should have gone forward to explore the eastern area and search for the box, instead of going back and forth.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the box, I should have explored the western area more thoroughly and examined the grey closed door at (4, 11) earlier. I should have also gone through the yellow open door at (6, 8) to access new areas and potential clues. Additionally, I should have moved south from (7, 7) to explore the area below the wall and potentially find the box or another path.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 4:\nYour mission is \"pick up the box\".
