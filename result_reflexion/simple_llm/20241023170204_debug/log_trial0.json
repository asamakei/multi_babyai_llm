    "Based on my previous experience, I realize that I should have been more cautious and not attempted to move east immediately. Since the goal is 11 steps to the east, I should have started by trying to move east in smaller increments to assess the terrain and avoid falling off the cliff.\n\nHere's my revised plan:\n\n1. Move west (back to the starting position) to reassess the environment and get a better sense of the layout.\n2. Move north to see if there's a path or a ledge that I can follow to the east.\n3. If there's no ledge, I'll try to move east in small increments (1-2 steps) to test the terrain and avoid the cliff.\n4. If I encounter a cliff, I'll move back to the starting position and try a different path or try to find an alternative route to the goal.\n5. Once I'm confident that I've found a safe path, I'll continue moving east in small increments, gradually increasing the distance until I reach the goal.\n\nBy being more cautious and methodical in my approach, I hope to avoid falling off the cliff and successfully reach the goal."
