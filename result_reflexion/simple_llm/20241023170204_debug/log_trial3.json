If I encounter a cliff, I'll move back to the starting position and try a different path or try to find an alternative route to the goal.\n5. Once I'm confident that I've found a safe path, I'll continue moving east in small increments, gradually increasing the distance until I reach the goal.\n\nBy being more cautious and methodical in my approach, I hope to avoid falling off the cliff and successfully reach the goal."
