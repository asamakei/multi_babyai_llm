    "Based on my past experience, I realize that I fell to the cliff because I didn't carefully consider the layout of the environment. Specifically, I didn't take the time to fully understand the boundaries of the grid and the location of the goal.\n\nMy new plan of action is to take a more cautious and deliberate approach. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. From my current position, I will move west to the wall and stop there. This will give me a sense of the boundaries of the grid and prevent me from making the same mistake again.\n2. Next, I will move north to the Nothing direction, which I assume is a safe area. I will stop here and assess my surroundings.\n3. From the Nothing area, I will move east 5 steps to get closer to the goal. I will stop and check my surroundings to ensure I'm not getting too close to the cliff.\n4. From here, I will move east 3 more steps to reach the goal. I will take my time and carefully observe my surroundings to ensure I'm not getting too close to the cliff or the wall.\n\nBy taking a more cautious and deliberate approach, I hope to successfully reach the goal without falling to the cliff again."
