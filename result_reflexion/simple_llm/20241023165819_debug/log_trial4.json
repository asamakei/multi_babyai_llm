To avoid this mistake, my new plan is to move east in small increments, checking my surroundings after each move to ensure I'm not approaching the cliff.\n\nHere's my revised plan:\n\n1. Move east 1 step and check my surroundings to make sure I'm not approaching the cliff.\n2. If I'm not at the cliff, move east 1 step again and check my surroundings again.\n3. Continue moving east in small increments, checking my surroundings after each move, until I reach the goal.\n\nAdditionally, I will keep in mind that my north is Nothing, south is Wall, and west is Wall, to avoid getting stuck in a dead-end or moving into an obstacle. By taking a more cautious and incremental approach, I should be able to reach the goal without falling off the cliff.\nTrial 1:\nBased on my past experience, I will devise a new plan to reach the goal as soon as possible.
