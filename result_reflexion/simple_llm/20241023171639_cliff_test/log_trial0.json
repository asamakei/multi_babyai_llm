    "Based on the past experience, I realize that I should not have moved directly east without exploring other options. Since the goal is 11 steps to the east, but there's a cliff in that direction, I should have looked for a safer path.\n\nNew plan:\n\n1. Move north to gather more information about the environment.\n2. Explore the northern direction to see if there's a way to go around the cliff.\n3. If the north direction is blocked or not feasible, try moving west to see if there's a path that can lead me to the goal safely.\n4. If the west direction is also blocked, try to find a way to create a safe path east by removing or navigating around the cliff.\n\nBy taking these steps, I hope to avoid falling off the cliff and find a safer route to the goal."
