Instead of trying to move south or west, I will focus on moving eastward as soon as possible.\n2. I will use the information that the goal is 11 steps to my east to guide my movement.\n3. I will move eastward in the most efficient way possible, taking into account the presence of walls and cliffs.\n4. If I encounter a cliff, I will turn north or south to avoid it and continue moving eastward.\n5. If I encounter a wall, I will turn north or south to avoid it and continue moving eastward.\n\nBy following this plan, I hope to reach the goal within the given time limit and avoid the mistakes of my previous attempts.\nHere is the task:\nReach the goal as soon as possible.\nYour north is Wall.
