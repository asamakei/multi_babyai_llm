   "Based on the history of my past experience, I have identified the following subgoal planning strategy to complete the task:\n\n1. **Go to the green key at (4, 3)**: This subgoal was successfully achieved, but it was not sufficient to complete the task. To improve this subgoal, I should have included the action \"pick up the green key\" to obtain the key.\n\n2. **Pick up the green key**: This subgoal was not achieved, and it is crucial to complete the task. I should have included this subgoal in my initial plan to ensure that I obtain the key.\n\n3. **Go to the green locked door**: After obtaining the green key, I should have planned to go to the green locked door to unlock it and access the area where the purple box is located.\n\n4. **Pick up the purple box**: This subgoal was not achieved, and it is the ultimate goal of the task. I should have included this subgoal in my plan after unlocking the green locked door.\n\nTo improve my subgoal planning strategy, I will make sure to include the following concrete subgoals:\n\n* Pick up the green key at (4, 3)\n* Go to the green locked door\n* Unlock the green locked door using the green key\n* Go to the purple box\n* Pick up the purple box\n\nBy including these subgoals in my plan, I believe I can complete the task efficiently and effectively."
