You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go to (4, 3)', 'Go to the green key at (4, 3)', 'Go to the green key.', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to the green key', 'go to the green key at (4, 3)', 'go to the green key at (4, 3)']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['pick up the green key at (4, 3)', 'get key', 'pick up the green key', 'go to the green key', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. \nGive your plan:"

    "Based on the history of my past experience, I have identified the following subgoal planning strategy to complete the task:\n\n1. **Go to the green key at (4, 3)**: This subgoal was successfully achieved, but it was not sufficient to complete the task. To improve this subgoal, I should have included the action \"pick up the green key\" to obtain the key.\n\n2. **Pick up the green key**: This subgoal was not achieved, and it is crucial to complete the task. I should have included this subgoal in my initial plan to ensure that I obtain the key.\n\n3. **Go to the green locked door**: After obtaining the green key, I should have planned to go to the green locked door to unlock it and access the area where the purple box is located.\n\n4. **Pick up the purple box**: This subgoal was not achieved, and it is the ultimate goal of the task. I should have included this subgoal in my plan after unlocking the green locked door.\n\nTo improve my subgoal planning strategy, I will make sure to include the following concrete subgoals:\n\n* Pick up the green key at (4, 3)\n* Go to the green locked door\n* Unlock the green locked door using the green key\n* Go to the purple box\n* Pick up the purple box\n\nBy including these subgoals in my plan, I believe I can complete the task efficiently and effectively."
