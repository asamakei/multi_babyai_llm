   "My new plan is to move forward to the purple box's location at (8, 1) by executing the \"go forward\" action, and then immediately pick up the purple box by executing the \"pick up the item in forward\" action. I should have done this instead of repeatedly trying to pick up the item without moving forward. By doing so, I would have successfully completed the task of picking up the purple box."
