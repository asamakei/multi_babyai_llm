You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['Turn left', 'go forward', 'go forward', 'Go to the wall', 'turn left', 'Turn around', 'go forward']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['Go to the green key location', 'Go to the green key', 'Go to green key', 'Go to the purple box', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal strategy to complete the task. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 5 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the mission, I plan to go to the green key location first, which is located at (4, 3), and pick it up. Then, I will use the key to unlock the door, if there is one, and head towards the purple box. I will adjust my route according to the environment and the location of the purple box."
