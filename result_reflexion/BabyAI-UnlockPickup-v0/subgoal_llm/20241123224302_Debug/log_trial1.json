For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task.

    "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'pick up green key', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move to empty space', 'move to an empty space', 'move to empty space', 'move forward', 'move to space (4, 3)', 'move to a space with no object', 'move to space with no object', 'move to empty space', 'move to (3, 1)', 'move west', 'move to an empty space', 'move to empty space', 'move down to row 2', 'move down', 'move to empty space', 'move to (2, 2)', 'move west', 'move to space (2, 2)', 'move west', 'move to empty space'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['move left', 'move west', 'move to empty space', 'move to a place where you can drop green key', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have planned to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box. I should have added a subgoal to find a safe place to drop the green key before going to the purple box. This would have allowed me to pick up the purple box successfully and complete the mission."
