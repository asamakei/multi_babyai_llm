You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move east', 'head towards green key', 'pick up green key', 'move right', 'move past current space', 'move down', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move east', 'move to door', 'move through door', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move to (6, 4)', 'move east', 'move east', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move down to row 1', 'move down to row 1', 'move down', 'move down to row 1', 'move down', 'move right', 'find purple box', 'move west', 'move to a place where you can drop green key']. However, You cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['move to (6, 2)', 'move west', 'move to a place where you can drop green key', 'drop green key', 'drop item', 'pick up object in forward', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move east', 'head towards green key', 'pick up green key', 'move right', 'move past current space', 'move down', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move east', 'move to door', 'move through door', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move to (6, 4)', 'move east', 'move east', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move down to row 1', 'move down to row 1', 'move down', 'move down to row 1', 'move down', 'move right', 'find purple box', 'move west', 'move to a place where you can drop green key'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['move to (6, 2)', 'move west', 'move to a place where you can drop green key', 'drop green key', 'drop item', 'pick up object in forward', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box, as I couldn't have two items at the same time. I should have planned to move to a place where I can drop the green key safely before going to the purple box. I could have achieved this by adding a subgoal to find a safe place to drop the green key before going to the purple box. This would have allowed me to pick up the purple box successfully and complete the mission."
