You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move to green locked door', 'open door', 'move down', 'move right', 'move down', 'move down', 'move down', 'move to (8, 1)', 'move to purple box', 'move to purple box']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['drop item', 'pick up purple box', 'drop green key', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, which was particularly useful output your new plan in the form of \"'B' is necessary to achieve 'A'. 'C' is necessary to achieve 'B'. 'D' is neccesary to achieve 'C'. ...\". \nGive only result:"
