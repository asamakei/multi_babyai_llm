Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task.

    "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'move to green key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'get green key', 'move to (5, 4)', 'move to green locked door', 'open door in forward', 'use green key', 'open green locked door', 'go right', 'go right', 'go down', 'go down', 'go left', 'go left'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go down', 'go to (5, 5)', 'go to (8, 1)', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have planned to go down from (7, 3) to reach (7, 5) and then go right to reach (8, 5) and then go down to reach (8, 1) where the purple box is located. I should have also planned to move to the purple box and pick it up to achieve the mission. Additionally, I should have avoided going left from (7, 4) as it led to a wall.",
