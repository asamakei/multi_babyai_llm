Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go down from (3, 3)', 'go down from (3, 2)', 'go down from (3, 1)', 'go down', 'go down from (3, 2)', 'go right', 'go right from (3, 4)', 'go left', 'go down from (3, 3)', 'go down from (3, 3)', 'go down from (3, 3)', 'go left', 'move to (2, 3)', 'go down from (2, 3)', 'go left', 'go left'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go down from (1, 3)', 'go down', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have planned to go down from (1, 4) to reach (1, 5) and then go right to reach (5, 5) and then go up to reach (8, 1) where the purple box is located.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go down', 'move left', 'go left', 'go down from (1, 1)', 'go right', 'go right from (1, 1)', 'go right from (2, 1)', 'go down from (2, 2)', 'go down from (2, 3)']. However, You cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go down from (2, 4)', 'go down', 'go right from (2, 2)', 'go right', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
