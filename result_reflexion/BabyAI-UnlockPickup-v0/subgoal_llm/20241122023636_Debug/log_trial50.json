You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move down', 'move down to green key', 'move right', 'move down to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move down to (4, 4)', 'move down', 'move to (5, 4)', 'move right', 'move left', 'move to (5, 4)', 'move left', 'open green locked door', 'open door in forward', 'move to (5, 4)', 'move right', 'move right', 'move right']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go down', 'move down to (7, 1)', 'move down', 'move right', 'move right to (8, 1)', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should prioritize moving down to the green key and picking it up, then use it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I should drop the green key and move right to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box. I should focus on moving towards the green key, the green locked door, and the purple box, avoiding unnecessary actions. Additionally, I should plan to move down to (1, 3) and then move right to the green locked door to open it, then move right to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box and achieve the mission as soon as possible.",
