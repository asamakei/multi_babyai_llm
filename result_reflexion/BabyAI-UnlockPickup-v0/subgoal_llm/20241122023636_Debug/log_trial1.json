You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'move to key', 'get green key', 'pick up green key', 'get key', 'move to door', 'move to door', 'use green key', 'use key', 'open door', 'move through door', 'move forward', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move forward', 'move north', 'move north', 'move to (8, 1)', 'move to box']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['move forward', 'drop green key', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
