   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

I should also remove unnecessary actions such as'move right to (4, 1)' and instead focus on moving towards the green key and the purple box.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move down to (3, 2)', 'move down', 'move down to (3, 1)', 'move down', 'move right to (4, 1)', 'move right', 'move down to (4, 3)', 'move down to (4, 3)', 'move down', 'move down to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move down to (4, 3)', 'move down to (4, 3)', 'move down', 'move down', 'move down', 'move down to (4, 4)', 'move down to (4, 4)', 'move down', 'move down to (5, 4)', 'open door in forward', 'use key', 'open door', 'move down to (5, 4)', 'move right to (5, 4)', 'move right']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['move down to (5, 5)', 'move down', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
