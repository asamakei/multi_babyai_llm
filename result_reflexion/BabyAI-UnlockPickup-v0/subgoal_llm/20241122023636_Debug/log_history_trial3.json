  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key after using it to unlock the door, allowing me to pick up the purple box. I should have also avoided repeating the same actions, such as turning left and right, and instead focused on moving towards the purple box.
