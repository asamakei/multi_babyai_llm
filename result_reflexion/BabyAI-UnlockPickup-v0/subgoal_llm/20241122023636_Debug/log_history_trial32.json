  "To achieve the mission, I should prioritize moving down to the green key and picking it up, then use it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I should drop the green key and move down to (8, 1) to reach the purple box more efficiently, instead of moving right to (8, 4). I should also avoid unnecessary actions such as'move right to (4, 1)' and focus on moving towards the green key and the purple box. Additionally, I should plan to move down to (5, 5) to avoid the wall and then move right to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box and achieve the mission as soon as possible.",
