   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move to green key', 'move to green key', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move east', 'move south', 'move to green locked door', 'move to green locked door', 'open door', 'use green key', 'open door in forward', 'move east', 'move east', 'move to (7, 4)', 'move east', 'move to (8, 4)', 'move to (9, 4)', 'move to (8, 4) then turn left', 'move to (8, 1)', 'move to (8, 2)']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go to (5, 4)', 'drop green key', 'drop carrying item forward', 'pick up purple box', 'move east', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key after using it to unlock the door, allowing me to pick up the purple box. I should have also avoided repeating the same actions, such as turning left and right, and instead focused on moving towards the purple box. Additionally, I should have prioritized the subgoal of picking up the purple box over other actions."
