   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should prioritize moving down to the green key and picking it up, then use it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I should drop the green key and move down to (5, 5) to avoid the wall, then move right to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box. I should avoid unnecessary actions such as moving right to (4, 1) and focus on moving towards the green key and the purple box.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go down', 'go down', 'move right to (4, 1)', 'move right', 'move right to green key', 'move down to key', 'move down', 'go down to green key', 'move down to key', 'move down', 'go down to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move down', 'open green locked door', 'go down', 'move down to (5, 5)', 'move down', 'drop green key', 'move right', 'go right']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go to (8, 1)', 'move right', 'move right to (8, 1)', 'move right to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
