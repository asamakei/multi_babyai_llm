  "To achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should prioritize moving down to the green key and picking it up, then use it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I should drop the green key and move right to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box. I should focus on moving towards the green key, the green locked door, and the purple box, avoiding unnecessary actions. Additionally, I should plan to move down to (8, 1) directly after picking up the green key and unlocking the door, instead of moving to (5, 5) first.",
