You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move to green locked door', 'use green key', 'open door in forward']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go down', 'move to (4, 5)', 'move down', 'move to (8, 1)', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the mission, I should have prioritized moving down to (8, 1) and picking up the purple box. I should have dropped the green key after using it to unlock the door, allowing me to pick up the purple box. I should have also avoided repeating the same actions, such as turning left and right, and instead focused on moving towards the purple box. Additionally, I should have added 'drop green key' to my subgoal list and removed unnecessary actions to improve my strategy.",
