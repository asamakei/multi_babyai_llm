  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To achieve the mission, I should prioritize moving down to (8, 1) and picking up the purple box. I should add'move down to green key' and 'pick up green key' to my subgoal list, and then use the green key to unlock the door, allowing me to pick up the purple box. I should also add 'drop green key' to my subgoal list after using it to unlock the door. Additionally, I should focus on moving towards the green key and the purple box, avoiding unnecessary actions such as'move right to (4, 1)'.",
