   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

I should add'move down to green key' and 'pick up green key' to my subgoal list, and then use the green key to unlock the door, allowing me to pick up the purple box. Additionally, I should add 'drop green key' to my subgoal list after using it to unlock the door, and focus on moving towards the green key and the purple box, avoiding unnecessary actions such as'move right to (4, 1)'.\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the mission, I should prioritize moving down to (8, 1) and picking up the purple box.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time.

However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['move right to (5, 4)', 'move right', 'move to green locked door', 'move down to (5, 4)', 'move down to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
