You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move down', 'move right', 'move down to green key', 'pick up green key', 'pick up green key', 'move down to (4, 3)', 'move down', 'move to green locked door', 'move to green locked door', 'move to (5, 4)', 'open green locked door with green key', 'open door in forward', 'open green locked door', 'go down', 'move down']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go down', 'move down to (3, 5)', 'move down', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the mission, I should prioritize moving down to (8, 1) and picking up the purple box. I should add'move down to green key' and 'pick up green key' to my subgoal list, and then use the green key to unlock the door, allowing me to pick up the purple box. Additionally, I should add 'drop green key' to my subgoal list after using it to unlock the door, and focus on moving towards the green key and the purple box, avoiding unnecessary actions such as'move right to (4, 1)'.",
