  "To achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should prioritize moving down to the green key and picking it up, then use it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I should drop the green key and move down to (5, 5) to avoid the wall, then move right to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box.
