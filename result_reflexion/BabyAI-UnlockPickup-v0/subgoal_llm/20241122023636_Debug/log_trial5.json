You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'move to key', 'pick up key', 'pick up', 'pick up green key', 'move to key and pick up', 'move down', 'move down', 'move down to (4, 1)', 'move down', 'move right', 'move right to (5, 1)', 'move right', 'move right']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['use green key on door', 'move right to (5, 1) and use green key', 'move right and use key', 'move right to (5, 1) and use key', 'move to (8, 1)', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
