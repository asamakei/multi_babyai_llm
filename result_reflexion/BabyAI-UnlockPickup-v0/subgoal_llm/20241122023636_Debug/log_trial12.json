You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move down to (3, 2)', 'move down', 'move down to (3, 1)', 'move down', 'move left to (2, 1)', 'move left', 'move left to (1, 1)', 'move right', 'move right to (4, 1)', 'move down to (1, 2)', 'move down to (2, 2)', 'move down', 'move down to (2, 3)', 'move down to (1, 2)', 'go down', 'move down', 'go down to (1, 3)', 'go down', 'move down', 'move down to (1, 4)', 'go down', 'go right', 'go right to green key', 'move right to (4, 3)', 'go right to green key', 'move right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'go right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'go right to green key', 'move to (4, 3)', 'move down to green key', 'pick up green key', 'go to (4, 4)']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go to (4, 4)', 'go right', 'go to green locked door', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
