   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\nThe following is your history:\nYou turned right.\ntime 21:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to green key', 'get green key', 'pick up', 'pick up green key', 'get green key', 'move to (4, 3)', 'move forward', 'move forward', 'move down', 'move west', 'move left', 'move left', 'move forward', 'move down', 'move forward', 'go to (2, 3)', 'move west', 'move left', 'move right', 'move left', 'move right', 'move to (0, 3)', 'move left']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['go left', 'move left', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output your plan in 3 to 6 sentences and output new subgoal list briefly in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', ...] for achievement the task. \nGive your plan and list:"

    "To complete the task, I should have focused on moving towards the purple box instead of going in circles. I should have used the walls to my advantage to navigate the space more efficiently. Upon re-examining the history, I noticed that I was close to the purple box at time 25, but I turned left instead of going forward. I should have also kept track of my surroundings better to avoid hitting walls and turning back.\n\nNew subgoal list: ['move to purple box', 'avoid hitting walls', 'keep track of surroundings','move forward when possible', 'use walls to navigate']"
