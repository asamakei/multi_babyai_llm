  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To complete the task, I should have focused on moving towards the purple box instead of going in circles. I should have used the walls to my advantage to navigate the space more efficiently. Upon re-examining the history, I noticed that I was close to the purple box at time 25, but I turned left instead of going forward. I should have also kept track of my surroundings better to avoid hitting walls and turning back.",
