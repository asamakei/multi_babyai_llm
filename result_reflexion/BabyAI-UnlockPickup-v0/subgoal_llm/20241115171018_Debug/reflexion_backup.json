   "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should first turn right at the starting position to face east, then go forward to (4, 1). Instead of trying to move north where I encountered a wall, I should go south to (4, 2) and then pick up the green key at (4, 3). Afterward, I should use the key to open the green locked door at (5, 4) and continue to go forward to retrieve the purple box."
