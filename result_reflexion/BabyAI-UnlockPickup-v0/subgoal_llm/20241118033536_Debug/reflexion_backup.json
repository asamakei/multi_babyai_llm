   "To achieve the task of picking up the purple box, I should have prioritized moving directly to (2, 2) after reaching (1, 1). Instead of spending time turning and trying to navigate around walls, I should have realized that moving directly to the right at (1, 1) to (2, 2) was my best option. From (1, 1), I should have gone right to (1, 2) first, and then right to (2, 2) to pick up the purple box. Avoid unnecessary turns and focus on moves that bring me closer to the target efficiently."
