    "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have moved directly west from the starting position to reach the open path, then gone forward until I reached the wall, turned right to face north, and moved forward to reach the green key. After picking up the green key, I should have gone to the green locked door and opened it, then moved east to reach the purple box. This plan would have saved time and allowed me to complete the task successfully.",
    "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have moved directly west from the starting position to reach the open path, then gone forward until I reached the wall, turned right to face north, and moved forward to reach the green key. However, since I already have the green key, I should have gone to the green locked door and opened it, then moved east to reach the purple box. I should have avoided turning left and right repeatedly, which wasted time and led to the failure.",
