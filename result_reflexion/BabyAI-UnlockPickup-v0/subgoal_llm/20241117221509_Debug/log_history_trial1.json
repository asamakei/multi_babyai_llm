  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have moved directly to the east to reach the box instead of going north and then turning right. I should have gone forward from (6, 4) to (6, 3), then (6, 2), and then (6, 1), and then turned right to face east and gone forward to (7, 1), (8, 1) to pick up the purple box. This plan would have saved time and allowed me to complete the task successfully.",
