I should have gone forward from (4, 4) to (4, 3), then turned left to face west and gone forward to (3, 3), then turned left again to face south and gone forward to (3, 4), then turned right to face east and gone forward to (4, 4), then turned left to face north and gone forward to (4, 3), then turned right to face east and gone forward to (5, 3), then turned left to face north and gone forward to (5, 2), then turned left to face west and gone forward to (4, 2), then turned left to face south and gone forward to (4, 1), then turned right to face east and gone forward to (5, 1), then turned left to face north and gone forward to (5, 0), then turned right to face east and gone forward to (6, 0), then turned left to face north and gone forward to (6, 1), then turned right to face east and gone forward to (7, 1), then turned left to face north and gone forward to (7, 0), then turned right to face east and gone forward to (8, 0), then turned left to face north and gone forward to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left from the starting position and moved directly west to reach the open path. Then, I should have gone forward until I reached the wall at (0, 1), turned right to face north, and moved forward to reach the purple box.
