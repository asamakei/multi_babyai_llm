  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have moved directly west from the starting position to reach the open path, then gone forward until I reached the wall, turned right to face east, and moved forward to reach the green locked door. Since I already have the green key, I should have opened the door and then moved east to reach the purple box. I should have avoided turning left and right repeatedly, which wasted time and led to the failure.",
