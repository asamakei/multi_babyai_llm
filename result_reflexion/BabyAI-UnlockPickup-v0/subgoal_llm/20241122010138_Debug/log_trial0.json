You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: [\"'move east'\", 'move to (4, 3)', 'pick up the green key', 'get green key', 'get key', \"'move to (4, 4)'\", \"'move to (5, 4)'\", 'move east', 'move to (4, 3)', \"'move east'\", \"'move to the green locked door'\", 'open green locked door with green key', 'open green locked door', 'open door', 'open the green locked door', 'move to (5, 4)', 'move to (6, 4)', \"'move east'\", \"'turn left'\", 'go to (9, 4)', \"'turn left\", 'move to (9, 3)', 'move to (9, 2)', 'move to (9, 1)', \"'turn left'\", \"'turn right\", \"'turn left'\"]. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['pick up the purple box', 'go to (8, 1)', 'go east', \"'move east'\", \"'move to (8, 1)'\", 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the subgoal \"pick up the purple box\", I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box, as I was unable to pick it up while holding the key. I should have also planned to move to the location of the purple box and then drop the key, rather than trying to pick up the box while holding the key. Additionally, I should have prioritized the subgoal \"pick up the purple box\" over the subgoal \"move to (9, 1)\", as achieving the mission was the ultimate goal."
