  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To achieve the subgoal \"pick up the purple box\", I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box, as I was unable to pick it up while holding the key. I should have also planned to move to the location of the purple box and then drop the key, rather than trying to pick up the box while holding the key. Additionally, I should have prioritized the subgoal \"pick up the purple box\" over the subgoal \"move to (9, 1)\", as achieving the mission was the ultimate goal.",
