  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone around the wall at (5,1) by turning left at time 26 and then going forward. I should have continued going forward until I reached the purple box at (8,1) instead of turning right and getting stuck. I should have also considered the green open door at (5,4) as a possible path to the purple box.",
  "Trial 1:",
  "My new plan is to go forward from the start, then turn right and continue going forward until I reach the green locked door at (5,4). I should then open the door and go through it, then go forward to reach the purple box. This approach eliminates the unnecessary repetition and ensures the task is completed within the time limit.",
  "Trial 2:",
  "My new plan is to go forward from the start, then turn left and continue going forward until I reach the green locked door at (5,4). I should then open the door and go through it, then go forward to reach the purple box. I should avoid turning right and going around the wall at (5,1) as it leads to a dead end, and instead focus on reaching the door and the box in a more direct path.",
