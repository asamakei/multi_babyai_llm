  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

  "My new plan is to go forward from the start, then turn right and continue going forward until I reach the green locked door at (5,4). I should then open the door and go through it, then go forward to reach the purple box. This approach eliminates the unnecessary repetition and ensures the task is completed within the time limit.",
