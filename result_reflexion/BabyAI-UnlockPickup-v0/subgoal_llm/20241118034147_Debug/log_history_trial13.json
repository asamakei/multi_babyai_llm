  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward from the start, then turned right and continued going forward until I reached the green locked door at (5,1), then turned right and gone forward, then turned left and gone forward to reach the green locked door at (5,4), then opened the door and gone through it. After going through the door, I should have turned right and gone forward to reach the purple box at (8,1) instead of turning left.",

Additionally, I should have kept track of my position and the walls to avoid getting stuck and turned back.",
