  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward from the start, then turned right and continued going forward until I reached the green open door at (5, 4), then gone through it, then turned left and gone down to reach the purple box at (8, 1). I should have avoided turning left at (5, 4) and instead gone forward to reach the green open door, then turned left and went down to reach the purple box. Additionally, I should have kept track of my position and the walls to avoid getting stuck and turned back, and gone down to (5,1) then gone right to (8,1).",
