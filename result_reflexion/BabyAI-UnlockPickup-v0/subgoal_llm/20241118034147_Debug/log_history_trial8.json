  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward from the start, then turned left and continued going forward until I reached the green locked door at (5,4). I should have then opened the door and gone through it, then gone forward to reach the purple box. This approach eliminates the unnecessary repetition of turning right and left, and ensures the task is completed within the time limit.",
