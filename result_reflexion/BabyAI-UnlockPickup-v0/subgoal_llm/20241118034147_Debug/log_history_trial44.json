  "I should have gone forward directly to reach the purple box initially, as it was already in my forward direction. I should have avoided repeating the 'go forward' action and instead focused on picking up the purple box as soon as I had the opportunity. Additionally, I should have picked up the purple box as soon as I had the chance, instead of repeating the 'go forward' action multiple times.",

I should have focused on completing the task efficiently and avoided unnecessary actions. Additionally, I should have been more decisive in my actions and avoided hesitation, which would have allowed me to complete the task within the given time limit.",
