  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward from the start, then turned left and continued going forward until I reached the green locked door at (5,4) is not correct, instead I should have gone forward from the start, then turned right and continued going forward until I reached the green locked door at (5,1), then turned right and gone forward, then turned left and gone forward to reach the green locked door at (5,4).

This approach ensures that I take the most direct route to the purple box while avoiding unnecessary turns and repetitions. I should have also kept track of my position and the walls to avoid getting stuck.",

I should have avoided turning left at (4, 1) and instead continued going forward to reach the green open door.
