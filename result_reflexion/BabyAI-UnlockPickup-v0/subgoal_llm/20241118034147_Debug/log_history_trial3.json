  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward from the start instead of repeating the same actions. My new plan is to go forward immediately, then pick up the item in forward, which is the purple box. This approach eliminates the unnecessary repetition and ensures the task is completed within the time limit.",
  "Trial 1:",

I should have continued going forward until I reached the purple box at (8,1) instead of turning right and getting stuck. I should have also considered the green open door at (5,4) as a possible path to the purple box.",
