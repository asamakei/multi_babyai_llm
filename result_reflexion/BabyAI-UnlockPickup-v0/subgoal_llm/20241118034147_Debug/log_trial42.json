      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone down directly from the starting position to (5, 0) and then gone right to (8, 0) and up to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box. I should have avoided going right initially and instead focused on moving down to reach the bottom row.
