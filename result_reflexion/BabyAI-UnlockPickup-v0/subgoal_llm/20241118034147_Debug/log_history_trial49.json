  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward directly to (8, 1) and picked up the purple box as soon as possible. I should have focused on completing the task efficiently and avoided unnecessary actions, specifically avoiding the repetition of the 'pick up the item in forward' action and the multiple 'go forward' actions when the purple box was already in front of me. Instead, I should have picked up the purple box immediately after reaching (8, 2) to complete the task efficiently.",

I should have focused on moving efficiently and avoiding hesitation, which would have allowed me to complete the task within the given time limit. Additionally, I should have used my green key to unlock the green locked door at (5, 4) if necessary, to reach the purple box.",
