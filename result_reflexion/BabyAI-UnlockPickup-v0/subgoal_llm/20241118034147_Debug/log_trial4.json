I should have continued going forward until I reached the purple box at (8,1) instead of turning right and getting stuck. I should have also considered the green open door at (5,4) as a possible path to the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to go forward from the start, then turn right and continue going forward until I reach the green locked door at (5,4).
