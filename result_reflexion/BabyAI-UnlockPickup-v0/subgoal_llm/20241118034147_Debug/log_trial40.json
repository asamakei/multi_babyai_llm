      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone down to (3, 0) directly from the starting position (3, 1) and then gone right to (8, 0) and up to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box. I should have avoided going up initially and instead focused on moving down and right to reach the purple box. Additionally, I should have used the green key to open the door if necessary, but in this case, it was not needed as the door was already open.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward directly from the starting position to reach the purple box, as it was already in my forward direction. I should have avoided repeating the 'pick up the item in forward' action and instead focused on moving forward to reach the box. Additionally, I should have been more mindful of my surroundings and the location of the purple box to avoid unnecessary actions.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone down directly from the starting position to (5, 0) and then gone right to (8, 0) and up to (8, 1) to pick up the purple box.
