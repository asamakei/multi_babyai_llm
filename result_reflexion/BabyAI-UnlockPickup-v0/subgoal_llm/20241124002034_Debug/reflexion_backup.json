   "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'get green key', 'pick up green key', 'open door', 'move forward', 'go right', 'drop green key', 'pick up green key', 'go right', 'go right'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['drop green key', 'go to purple box', 'move right', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have planned to drop the green key after using it to open the door, so I can pick up the purple box. I should have also considered the constraint that I can only hold one item at a time. Additionally, I should have planned to move to the purple box after going through the green open door and then pick up the purple box. I should have added a subgoal 'drop green key' before 'pick up purple box' to my plan.",
