I should have also considered the constraint that I can only hold one item at a time and planned to drop the green key after using it to open the door.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'get green key', 'move to green locked door', 'move forward', 'move to green locked door', 'open door', 'open green locked door', 'move forward', 'go through green open door', 'move down', 'move down', 'go down', 'move down', 'go right', 'go right', 'move right', 'move to purple box']. However, You cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['drop green key', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
