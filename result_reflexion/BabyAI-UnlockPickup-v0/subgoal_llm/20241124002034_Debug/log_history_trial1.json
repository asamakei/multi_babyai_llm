  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to (4,3)', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'get green key', 'move right', 'move forward', 'move forward', 'move to (5, 4)', 'use green key', 'open door', 'move forward', 'go down', 'move down', 'go right', 'move right', 'go right', 'move to purple box', 'go left'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].",
  "To achieve the subgoal 'pick up purple box', I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box. I can improve my plan by adding a subgoal 'drop green key' before 'pick up purple box'. Additionally, I should have considered the constraint that I can only hold one item at a time, and planned accordingly. By dropping the green key, I would have been able to pick up the purple box and achieve the mission.",
