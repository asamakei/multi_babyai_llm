   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to (4,3)', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'get green key', 'move right', 'move forward', 'move forward', 'move to (5, 4)', 'use green key', 'open door', 'move forward', 'go down', 'move down', 'go right', 'move right', 'go right', 'move to purple box', 'go left'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the subgoal 'pick up purple box', I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box. I can improve my plan by adding a subgoal 'drop green key' before 'pick up purple box'. Additionally, I should have considered the constraint that I can only hold one item at a time, and planned accordingly. By dropping the green key, I would have been able to pick up the purple box and achieve the mission.\nTrial 1:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move right', 'move forward', 'go right', 'go right', 'go right', 'go right', 'move right', 'move right', 'go right', 'move right'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go right', 'move to green door', 'go through green open door', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have planned to drop the green key after using it to open the door, so I can pick up the purple box. I should have also considered the constraint that I can only hold one item at a time. Additionally, I should have planned to move to the purple box after going through the green open door.\nTrial 2:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move forward', 'move to green locked door', 'move forward', 'move to (7, 4)', 'go right', 'move down', 'go down', 'move down'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['move right', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have planned to drop the green key after using it to open the door, so I can pick up the purple box.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'get green key', 'pick up green key', 'open door', 'move forward', 'go right', 'drop green key', 'pick up green key', 'go right', 'go right']. However, You cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['drop green key', 'go to purple box', 'move right', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
