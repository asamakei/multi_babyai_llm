   "Based on the past experience, I have identified some improvements to the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task efficiently.\n\n**Useful subgoals:**\n\n1. Head to the green key: This subgoal is crucial as it allows us to obtain the green key, which can be used to unlock the green locked door.\n2. Go through the green locked door: Once we have the green key, we can use it to unlock the door and pass through it.\n3. Head to the purple box: After going through the green locked door, we need to navigate to the location of the purple box.\n4. Pick up the purple box: This is the final subgoal, where we actually pick up the purple box and complete the mission.\n\n**Subgoals that should be improved or removed:**\n\n1. Go to (4, 3): This subgoal is not necessary and can be removed.\n2. Go around the wall to the green locked door: Instead of going around the wall, we can try to find a more direct path to the green locked door.\n3. Go to green key at (4, 3): This subgoal is redundant and can be merged with the Head to the green key subgoal.\n\n**Additional subgoals that could be useful:**\n\n1. Explore the area to gather more information about the environment and potential obstacles.\n2. Try to find alternative paths to the purple box in case the initial path is blocked.\n\n**Improved subgoal planning strategy:**\n\n1. Head to the green key and pick it up.\n2. Go through the green locked door.\n3. Head to the purple box.\n4. Pick up the purple box.\n\nBy refining our subgoal planning strategy, we can increase our chances of completing the task efficiently and effectively.",
   "To complete the task of achieving the \"mission\" as soon as possible, which is to pick up the purple box, I would plan the following subgoals:\n\n1. Head to the green key: This subgoal is crucial as it allows us to obtain the green key, which can be used to unlock the green locked door.\n2. Go through the green locked door: Once we have the green key, we can use it to unlock the door and pass through it.\n3. Head to the purple box: After going through the green locked door, we need to navigate to the location of the purple box.\n4. Pick up the purple box: This is the final subgoal, where we actually pick up the purple box and complete the mission.\n\nImprovements to the previous plan:\n\n* Instead of going around the wall, we can try to find a more direct path to the green key.\n* We should prioritize going through the green locked door as soon as possible, rather than exploring other areas.\n* We need to plan a more efficient route to the purple box after going through the green locked door.\n\nAdditional subgoals that could be useful:\n\n* Explore the area to gather more information about the environment and potential obstacles.\n* Try to find alternative paths to the purple box in case the initial path is blocked.\n\nSubgoals that should be removed or improved:\n\n* Go to (4, 3) is not a necessary subgoal and can be removed.\n* Go to the green key and Go to green locked door can be merged into a single subgoal, Head to the green key and door.\n* Open green locked door is not necessary as we already have the green key.\n\nBy improving and refining our subgoal planning strategy, we can increase our chances of completing the task efficiently and effectively.\n\nSpecifically, the following subgoals should be executed:\n\n1. Head to the green key.\n2. Pick up the green key.\n3. Head to the green locked door.\n4. Go through the green locked door.\n5. Head to the purple box.\n6. Pick up the purple box.\n\nBy following this plan, we can efficiently complete the task and achieve the mission.",
