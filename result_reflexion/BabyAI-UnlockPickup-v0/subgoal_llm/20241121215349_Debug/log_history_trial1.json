  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "Your memory for the task below:",

  "To complete the task of achieving the \"mission\" as soon as possible, which is to pick up the purple box, I would plan the following subgoals:",
  "",
  "1. Head to the green key: This subgoal is crucial as it allows us to obtain the green key, which can be used to unlock the green locked door.",
  "2. Go through the green locked door: Once we have the green key, we can use it to unlock the door and pass through it.",
  "3. Head to the purple box: After going through the green locked door, we need to navigate to the location of the purple box.",
  "4. Pick up the purple box: This is the final subgoal, where we actually pick up the purple box and complete the mission.",
  "",
  "Improvements to the previous plan:",
  "",
  "* Instead of going around the wall, we can try to find a more direct path to the green key.",
  "* We should prioritize going through the green locked door as soon as possible, rather than exploring other areas.",
  "* We need to plan a more efficient route to the purple box after going through the green locked door.",
  "",
  "Additional subgoals that could be useful:",
  "",
  "* Explore the area to gather more information about the environment and potential obstacles.",
  "* Try to find alternative paths to the purple box in case the initial path is blocked.",
  "",
  "Subgoals that should be removed or improved:",
  "",
  "* Go to (4, 3) is not a necessary subgoal and can be removed.",
  "* Go to the green key and Go to green locked door can be merged into a single subgoal, Head to the green key and door.",
  "* Open green locked door is not necessary as we already have the green key.",
  "",
  "By improving and refining our subgoal planning strategy, we can increase our chances of completing the task efficiently and effectively.",
