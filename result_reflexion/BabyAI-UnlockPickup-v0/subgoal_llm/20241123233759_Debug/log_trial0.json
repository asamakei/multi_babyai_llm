You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['explore surrounding', 'move right', 'move forward', 'move to (4, 1)', 'move to (4, 2)', 'move forward', 'move to (4, 2)', 'move down', 'move south', 'move to key', 'move down', 'move to (4, 4)', 'move left', 'use key', 'open door', 'move forward', 'move right', 'move down']. However, You cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['move down', 'move to (8, 1)', 'find purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['explore surrounding', 'move right', 'move forward', 'move to (4, 1)', 'move to (4, 2)', 'move forward', 'move to (4, 2)', 'move down', 'move south', 'move to key', 'move down', 'move to (4, 4)', 'move left', 'use key', 'open door', 'move forward', 'move right', 'move down'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['move down', 'move to (8, 1)', 'find purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on moving down to reach the purple box at (8, 1) instead of exploring the surrounding area. I should have planned a more direct route to the purple box, using the green key to open the door if necessary. Additionally, I should have prioritized moving down to reach the box instead of moving right and left unnecessarily."
