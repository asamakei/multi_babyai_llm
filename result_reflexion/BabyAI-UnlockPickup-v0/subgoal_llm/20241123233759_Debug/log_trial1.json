You think you should achieve subgoals ['move to (4, 3)', 'move right', 'move down to (8, 1)', 'move down', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Output only one subgoal for achieving 'move to (4, 3)' in a few words, abstractly at first, then gradually more concretely. Do not output subgoals with the same meaning.\nYour subgoal:"
