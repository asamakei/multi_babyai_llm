  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To complete the task, I plan to first pick up the green key and then drop it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I will go east to reach the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission. I will avoid unnecessary back-and-forth movements and focus on a direct path to the purple box. Additionally, I will make sure to drop the green key before trying to pick up the purple box, as carrying the key prevented me from picking up the box in the past trial.",
