I should prioritize picking up the purple box over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible. I should avoid repeated attempts to go forward when it's clear that it's not possible, and instead turn around and explore other paths to reach the purple box.

I should prioritize picking up the purple box over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible. I should avoid repeated attempts to go forward when it's clear that it's not possible, and instead turn around and explore other paths to reach the purple box.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go right', 'use green key', 'go to green locked door', 'drop green key', 'pick up green key'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['drop green key', 'use green key', 'open door', 'go east', 'go to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key first, then pick up the purple box. I should prioritize picking up the purple box over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible. I should avoid repeated attempts to go forward when it's clear that it's not possible, and instead turn around and explore other paths to reach the purple box. I should also improve my subgoal planning strategy by adding concrete steps to drop the green key and use it to open the door, which would have allowed me to access the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go east', 'drop green key'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['pick up green key', 'go to green locked door', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key after picking it up, then used it to open the green locked door.

      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go right', 'use green key', 'go to green locked door', 'drop green key', 'pick up green key'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['drop green key', 'use green key', 'open door', 'go east', 'go to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key first, then pick up the purple box. I should prioritize picking up the purple box over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible. I should avoid repeated attempts to go forward when it's clear that it's not possible, and instead turn around and explore other paths to reach the purple box. I should also improve my subgoal planning strategy by adding concrete steps to drop the green key and use it to open the door, which would have allowed me to access the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go east', 'drop green key'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['pick up green key', 'go to green locked door', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key after picking it up, then used it to open the green locked door. After opening the door, I should have gone east to reach the purple box and picked it up to complete the mission. I should prioritize dropping the green key and using it to open the door over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible.

After unlocking the door, I will go east to reach the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission. I will avoid unnecessary back-and-forth movements and focus on a direct path to the purple box.

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go right', 'use green key', 'go to green locked door', 'drop green key', 'pick up green key'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['drop green key', 'use green key', 'open door', 'go east', 'go to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key first, then pick up the purple box. I should prioritize picking up the purple box over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible. I should avoid repeated attempts to go forward when it's clear that it's not possible, and instead turn around and explore other paths to reach the purple box. I should also improve my subgoal planning strategy by adding concrete steps to drop the green key and use it to open the door, which would have allowed me to access the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go east', 'drop green key'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['pick up green key', 'go to green locked door', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key after picking it up, then used it to open the green locked door. After opening the door, I should have gone east to reach the purple box and picked it up to complete the mission. I should prioritize dropping the green key and using it to open the door over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible. I should also improve my subgoal planning strategy by adding concrete steps to drop the green key and use it to open the door, which would have allowed me to access the purple box.\nTrial 2:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go east', 'go to (5, 4)', 'go to green locked door', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to (4, 4)', 'go to (4, 4)', 'go to (4, 3)'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go back to (4, 4)', 'go back', 'drop key', 'drop green key', 'open green locked door', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo complete the task, I plan to first pick up the green key and then drop it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I will go east to reach the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission. I will avoid unnecessary back-and-forth movements and focus on a direct path to the purple box.
