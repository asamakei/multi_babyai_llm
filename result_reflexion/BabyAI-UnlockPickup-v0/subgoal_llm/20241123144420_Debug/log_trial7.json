   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to green key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'drop key', 'pick up key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to (4, 4)', 'go to (4, 4)', 'drop key', 'drop green key', 'drop key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'use key on door', 'use key', 'open door', 'go east', 'go east', 'go east'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (8, 1)', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I plan to first pick up the green key and then drop it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I will go east to reach the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission. I will avoid unnecessary back-and-forth movements and focus on a direct path to the purple box. Additionally, I will make sure to drop the green key before trying to pick up the purple box, as carrying the key prevented me from picking up the box in the past trial.\nTrial 1:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to green key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'drop key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'pick up key', 'go right', 'go east', 'go to green locked door', 'open green locked door with key', 'open green locked door', 'go east', 'go east', 'go to (7, 4)', 'go east', 'go to (9, 4)', 'go to (9, 3)', 'go down to (8, 2)', 'go down', 'go down', 'go to (8, 1)'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['drop key', 'drop green key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up purple box', 'go east', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I plan to first pick up the green key and then drop it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I will go east to reach the purple box. To pick up the purple box, I will make sure to drop the green key first, as carrying the key prevented me from picking up the box in the past trial. I will also avoid unnecessary back-and-forth movements and focus on a direct path to the purple box.\nTrial 2:\nI planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'drop key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go east', 'go east'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go to (4, 2)', 'go up', 'go back to (3, 3)', 'go to green key', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I plan to first pick up the green key and then drop it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I will go east to reach the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission. I will avoid unnecessary back-and-forth movements and focus on a direct path to the purple box.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go right', 'drop key', 'pick up green key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go right', 'go right', 'go to green locked door', 'open green locked door', 'go to (5, 4)', 'go east', 'go to (6, 4)', 'go east', 'go east', 'go down', 'go to (8, 1)']. However, You cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['pick up item in forward', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
