You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'pick up key', 'go right', 'go south', 'use green key', 'open door', 'go east', 'go right', 'go down', 'go down', 'go to purple box']. However, You cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go down to (8, 1)', 'go down', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'pick up key', 'go right', 'go south', 'use green key', 'open door', 'go east', 'go right', 'go down', 'go down', 'go to purple box'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go down to (8, 1)', 'go down', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key first, then pick up the purple box. I should have also avoided the repeated attempts to go forward when it was clear that it was not possible. Instead, I could have turned around and explored other paths to reach the purple box. Additionally, I should have prioritized picking up the purple box over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible."
