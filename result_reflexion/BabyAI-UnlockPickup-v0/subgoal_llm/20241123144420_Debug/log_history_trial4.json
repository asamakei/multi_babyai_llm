  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go right', 'use green key', 'go to green locked door', 'drop green key', 'pick up green key'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['drop green key', 'use green key', 'open door', 'go east', 'go to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].",
  "To achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key first, then pick up the purple box. I should prioritize picking up the purple box over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible. I should avoid repeated attempts to go forward when it's clear that it's not possible, and instead turn around and explore other paths to reach the purple box. I should also improve my subgoal planning strategy by adding concrete steps to drop the green key and use it to open the door, which would have allowed me to access the purple box.",

  "To achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key after picking it up, then used it to open the green locked door.

  "To complete the task, I plan to first pick up the green key and then drop it to unlock the green locked door. After unlocking the door, I will go east to reach the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission. I will avoid unnecessary back-and-forth movements and focus on a direct path to the purple box. Additionally, I will make sure to drop the green key before trying to pick up the purple box, as carrying the key prevented me from picking up the box in the past trial.",
