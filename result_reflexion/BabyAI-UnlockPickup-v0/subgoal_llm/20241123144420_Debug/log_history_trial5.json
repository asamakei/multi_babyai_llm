  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go east', 'drop green key'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['pick up green key', 'go to green locked door', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].",
  "To achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key after picking it up, then used it to open the green locked door. After opening the door, I should have gone east to reach the purple box and picked it up to complete the mission. I should prioritize dropping the green key and using it to open the door over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible. I should also improve my subgoal planning strategy by adding concrete steps to drop the green key and use it to open the door, which would have allowed me to access the purple box.",

After unlocking the door, I will go east to reach the purple box and pick it up to complete the mission.
