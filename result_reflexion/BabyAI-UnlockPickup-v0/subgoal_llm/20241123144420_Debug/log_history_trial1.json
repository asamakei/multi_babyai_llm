  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['go right', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go to key', 'go to key', 'pick up item in forward', 'pick up green key', 'pick up key', 'go right', 'go south', 'use green key', 'open door', 'go east', 'go right', 'go down', 'go down', 'go to purple box'], but cannot achieved the following subgoal list ['go down to (8, 1)', 'go down', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].",
  "To achieve the mission, I should have dropped the green key first, then pick up the purple box. I should have also avoided the repeated attempts to go forward when it was clear that it was not possible. Instead, I could have turned around and explored other paths to reach the purple box. Additionally, I should have prioritized picking up the purple box over other actions to focus on completing the mission as soon as possible.",
