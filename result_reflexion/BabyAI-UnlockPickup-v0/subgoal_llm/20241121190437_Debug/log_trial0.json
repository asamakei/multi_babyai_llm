You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['Go to the green key', 'Head to the green key', 'Explore around to find the green key', 'Pick up the green key', 'Get green key', 'Go through the green locked door', 'Go to the green locked door', 'Head to the green locked door', 'Head to the east', 'Head east to purple box', 'Head east', 'Head down', 'Go down to purple box', 'Go to the purple box', 'Go down', 'Go down to purple box', 'Head to the purple box', 'Find the purple box', 'Go right to purple box', 'Go down to purple box row', 'Go down to row 1', 'Go down to purple box']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['pick up purple box', 'pick up purple box in front of you', 'Pick up purple box in front', 'Pick up purple box', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. You will need this as your memory 'Trial 4' later when you are solving the same task. Output without repeating memory of previous trials. \nGive your plan:"

    "Based on the history of the past experience, I can identify some issues with the subgoal planning strategy that led to the failure to complete the task. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Inefficient exploration**: The plan spent a lot of time exploring around to find the green key, which was not necessary. A more efficient approach would be to head directly to the green key or the green locked door.\n2. **Insufficient focus on the mission**: The plan got distracted by exploring and didn't focus enough on the main mission, which was to pick up the purple box. A more effective approach would be to prioritize the mission and focus on finding the purple box as soon as possible.\n3. **Lack of adaptability**: The plan didn't adapt well to the environment and the agent's current state. For example, when the agent had the green key, the plan didn't adjust to focus on finding the purple box. A more adaptable approach would be to reassess the situation and adjust the plan accordingly.\n4. **Ineffective use of actions**: The plan used a lot of \"head\" actions, which didn't seem to be effective in achieving the subgoals. A more effective approach would be to use more specific actions, such as \"go to\" or \"pick up\".\n\nWith these observations in mind, here's a revised plan for the task:\n\n1. **Go to the green key**: Head directly to the green key and pick it up.\n2. **Go through the green locked door**: Use the green key to unlock the door and go through it.\n3. **Find the purple box**: Focus on finding the purple box and head directly to it.\n4. **Pick up the purple box**: Once the purple box is found, pick it up immediately.\n\nThis revised plan prioritizes the mission, uses more efficient actions, and adapts to the environment and the agent's current state."
