  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "Based on the history of the past experience, I can identify some issues with the subgoal planning strategy that led to the failure to complete the task. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:",
  "",
  "1. **Inefficient exploration**: The plan spent a lot of time exploring around to find the green key, which was not necessary. A more efficient approach would be to head directly to the green key or the green locked door.",
  "2. **Insufficient focus on the mission**: The plan got distracted by exploring and didn't focus enough on the main mission, which was to pick up the purple box. A more effective approach would be to prioritize the mission and focus on finding the purple box as soon as possible.",
  "3. **Lack of adaptability**: The plan didn't adapt well to the environment and the agent's current state. For example, when the agent had the green key, the plan didn't adjust to focus on finding the purple box. A more adaptable approach would be to reassess the situation and adjust the plan accordingly.",
  "4. **Ineffective use of actions**: The plan used a lot of \"head\" actions, which didn't seem to be effective in achieving the subgoals. A more effective approach would be to use more specific actions, such as \"go to\" or \"pick up\".",
