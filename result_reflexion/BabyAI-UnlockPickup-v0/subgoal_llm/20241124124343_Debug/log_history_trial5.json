  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To achieve the mission of picking up the purple box, I should have planned a more efficient route to the box's location. Upon obtaining the green key and unlocking the green door, I should have turned left and moved down towards the purple box instead of moving east again. This would have allowed me to reach the box's location sooner and pick it up before running out of time. I should have also prioritized the subgoal of moving down to the purple box after unlocking the green door.",
