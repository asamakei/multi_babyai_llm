You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'move to green key', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move forward', 'move left', 'turn around', 'turn around', 'turn around', 'turn around', 'turn around', 'turn around']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['turn around', 'go backward', 'move backward', 'drop item', 'drop green key', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output your plan in 3 to 6 sentences and output new subgoal list briefly in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', ...] for achievement the task. \nGive your plan and list:"

    "Based on the past experience, I realized that I should have planned a more efficient route to the green key and the purple box. I should have also dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box, as carrying an item prevented me from picking up another one. To achieve the task, I should have focused on moving directly to the green key, picking it up, and then dropping it before moving to the purple box. I should have also avoided revisiting the same locations and focused on moving efficiently to the purple box.\n\nNew subgoal list: ['move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'drop green key','move to purple box', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible', 'avoid carrying items while picking up other items','move efficiently to the purple box', 'use the green key to unlock the green locked door', 'avoid revisiting same locations', 'turn around and go backward when necessary']",
