   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the past experience, I realized that I should have planned a more efficient route to the purple box after obtaining the green key. I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box, as carrying an item prevented me from picking up another one. I should have also avoided revisiting the same locations and focused on moving directly to the purple box.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'drop item', 'drop green key', 'move forward', 'move right', 'move east', 'move to (4, 2)', 'pick up key', 'move forward', 'move down to (1, 2)', 'move down', 'move down', 'move down to (1, 5)', 'move down', 'move right', 'move east', 'move east', 'move east']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['move to (4, 4) and then east', 'move to (5, 4)', 'move east', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output your plan in 3 to 6 sentences and output new subgoal list briefly in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', ...] for achievement the task. \nGive your plan and list:"
