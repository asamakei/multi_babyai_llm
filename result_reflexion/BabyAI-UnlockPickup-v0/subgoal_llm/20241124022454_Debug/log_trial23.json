   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the past experience, I realized that I should have planned a more efficient route to the purple box and focused on moving directly to it after dropping the green key.

Additionally, I should have avoided revisiting the same locations and focused on moving efficiently to the purple box.\n\nNew subgoal list: ['move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'drop green key before moving to purple box','move down to purple box', 'turn left to face the purple box','move forward to the purple box', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible', 'avoid carrying items while picking up other items','move efficiently to the purple box', 'use the green key to unlock the green locked door', 'avoid revisiting same locations', 'turn around and go backward when necessary', 'plan a more efficient route to the purple box', 'drop item after picking up green key', 'drop item before picking up purple box']\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the task, I should have focused on moving directly to the green locked door after picking up the green key.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'pick up green key', 'go down', 'move down', 'move right', 'turn right and go backward', 'move right to green locked door', 'open door', 'open green locked door', 'move forward through door', 'move forward']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['go down', 'move down', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output your plan in 3 to 6 sentences and output new subgoal list briefly in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', ...] for achievement the task. \nGive your plan and list:"
