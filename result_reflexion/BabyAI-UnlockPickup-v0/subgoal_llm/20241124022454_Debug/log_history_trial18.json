  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To achieve the task, I should have focused on moving directly to the green key, picking it up, and then dropping it before moving to the purple box. I should have also avoided revisiting the same locations and focused on moving efficiently to the purple box. Additionally, I should have planned a more efficient route to the purple box after obtaining the green key. To achieve the subgoal of dropping the green key, I could have done so by adding a 'drop item' action after picking up the green key. To achieve the subgoal of moving to the purple box, I could have done so by adding a'move to purple box' action after dropping the green key.
