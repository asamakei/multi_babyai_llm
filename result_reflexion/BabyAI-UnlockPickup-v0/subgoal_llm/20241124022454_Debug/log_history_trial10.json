  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box, as carrying an item prevented me from picking up another one. I should have also avoided revisiting the same locations and focused on moving directly to the purple box.
