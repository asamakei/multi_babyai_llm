   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task, I should have planned a more efficient route to the purple box. Upon obtaining the green key, I should have moved directly to the purple box instead of exploring other areas. I should have also avoided revisiting the same locations, such as moving left and right between the same coordinates.\n\nNew subgoal list: ['move to green key', 'pick up green key','move to purple box', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I should have planned a more efficient route to the purple box.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move right', 'move down', 'move left', 'open door', 'use green key', 'open green locked door', 'go through door', 'move forward', 'move down to (6, 0)', 'move right', 'move east', 'move to (8, 1)', 'move to purple box']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['drop green key', 'move forward', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output your plan in 3 to 6 sentences and output new subgoal list briefly in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', ...] for achievement the task. \nGive your plan and list:"
