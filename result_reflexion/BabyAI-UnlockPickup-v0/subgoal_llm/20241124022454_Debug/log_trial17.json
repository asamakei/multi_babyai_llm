However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['go down', 'move down to (2, 0)', 'move down', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output your plan in 3 to 6 sentences and output new subgoal list briefly in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', ...] for achievement the task. \nGive your plan and list:"

To achieve the task, I should have focused on moving directly to the green key, picking it up, and then dropping it before moving to the purple box. I should have also avoided revisiting the same locations and focused on moving efficiently to the purple box. Additionally, I should have planned a more efficient route to the purple box after obtaining the green key.\n\nNew subgoal list: ['move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'drop green key','move to purple box', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible', 'avoid carrying items while picking up other items','move efficiently to the purple box', 'use the green key to unlock the green locked door', 'avoid revisiting same locations', 'turn around and go backward when necessary', 'plan a more efficient route to the purple box', 'drop item after picking up green key']",
    "Based on the past experience, I realized that I should have planned a more efficient route to the purple box and focused on moving directly to it after dropping the green key. To achieve the subgoal of moving to the purple box, I could have done so by adding a'move down' action after dropping the green key. To achieve the subgoal of achieving the mission as soon as possible, I could have done so by adding a'move to purple box' and 'pick up purple box' action after moving down. I should have also avoided revisiting the same locations and focused on moving efficiently to the purple box.\n\nNew subgoal list: ['move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'drop green key','move down to purple box', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible', 'avoid carrying items while picking up other items','move efficiently to the purple box', 'use the green key to unlock the green locked door', 'avoid revisiting same locations', 'turn around and go backward when necessary', 'plan a more efficient route to the purple box', 'drop item after picking up green key','move down after dropping green key']"
