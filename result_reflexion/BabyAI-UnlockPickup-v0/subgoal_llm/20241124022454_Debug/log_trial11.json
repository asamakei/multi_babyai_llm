You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'move to green key', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move left', 'move forward', 'move forward', 'move down', 'move left', 'go left', 'move left', 'move left', 'move to (3, 3)', 'move to safe place', 'move to (3, 3)', 'move right', 'move forward', 'move forward', 'move right']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['move forward', 'move to (4, 4)', 'move to safe place', 'drop green key', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output your plan in 3 to 6 sentences and output new subgoal list briefly in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', ...] for achievement the task. \nGive your plan and list:"
