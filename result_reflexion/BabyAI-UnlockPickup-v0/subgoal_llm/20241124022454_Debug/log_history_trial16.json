  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "Based on the past experience, I realized that I should have planned a more efficient route to the green key and the purple box. I should have also dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box, as carrying an item prevented me from picking up another one. To achieve the task, I should have focused on moving directly to the green key, picking it up, and then dropping it before moving to the purple box. I should have also avoided revisiting the same locations and focused on moving efficiently to the purple box.",
