  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "Based on the past experience, I realized that I should have planned a more efficient route to the purple box and focused on moving directly to it after dropping the green key. To achieve the subgoal of moving to the purple box, I could have done so by adding a'move down' action after dropping the green key. To achieve the subgoal of achieving the mission as soon as possible, I could have done so by adding a'move to purple box' and 'pick up purple box' action after moving down.
