  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To achieve the mission of picking up the purple box, I should have explored the environment more efficiently by going forward through the green door and then turning left or right to find the box, instead of turning left and right repeatedly at the same spot. I should have also considered moving in the opposite direction, towards (8, 1), to potentially find the purple box. Additionally, I should have been more mindful of my surroundings and taken note of the walls and doors to avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop.",
