   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward one more step at time 22 to reach (8, 1) and then picked up the box. Instead of trying to pick up the box multiple times, I should have focused on moving forward to reach the box. Additionally, I should have avoided turning left and right unnecessarily, and kept track of my surroundings to avoid missing the box.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone through the green open door at (5, 4) and then turned left to head west towards the purple box. Instead of turning left at time 29, I should have gone forward one more step to reach (5, 4) and then turned left to reach the purple box at (8, 1). I should have also kept track of my surroundings to avoid going too far east and missing the box.\nTrial 2:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone through the green open door at (5, 4) and then turned left to head west towards the purple box. Instead of turning left at time 29, I should have gone forward one more step to reach (3, 4) and then turned left to reach the purple box at (8, 1). I should have also kept track of my surroundings to avoid going too far east and missing the box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\nThe following is your history.\nYou couldn't took a step forward.\ntime 21:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".

You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the strategy and path you took to attempt to complete the task. Devise a concise, new plan of action that accounts for your mistake with reference to specific actions that you should have taken. For example, if you tried A and B but forgot C, then devise a plan to achieve C with environment-specific actions. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 5 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
