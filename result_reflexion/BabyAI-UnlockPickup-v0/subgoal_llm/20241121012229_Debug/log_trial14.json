You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the strategy and path you took to attempt to complete the task. Devise a concise, new plan of action that accounts for your mistake with reference to specific actions that you should have taken. For example, if you tried A and B but forgot C, then devise a plan to achieve C with environment-specific actions. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 5 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward one more step at time 22 to reach (8, 1) and then picked up the box. Instead of trying to pick up the box multiple times, I should have focused on moving forward to reach the box. Additionally, I should have avoided turning left and right unnecessarily, and kept track of my surroundings to avoid missing the box.",
