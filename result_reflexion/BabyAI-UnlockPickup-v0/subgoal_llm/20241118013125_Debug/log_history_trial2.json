  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left at time 21 to face west, then moved forward to (4, 4), and continued moving forward until reaching the purple box at (8, 1). I should have avoided turning right multiple times, which led to revisiting the same positions. By moving forward from (5, 4) towards the west, I would have saved time and reached the purple box more efficiently.",
