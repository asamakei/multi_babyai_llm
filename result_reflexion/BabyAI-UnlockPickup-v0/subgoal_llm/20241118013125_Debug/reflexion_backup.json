   "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left at time 21 to face west, then moved forward to (4, 4), and continued moving forward until reaching the purple box at (8, 1). I should have avoided turning right multiple times, which led to revisiting the same positions. By moving forward from (5, 4) towards the west, I would have saved time and reached the purple box more efficiently.",
   "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left at time 21 to face east, then moved forward until reaching the green key at (4, 3), and used it to unlock the green locked door at (5, 4). After that, I should have moved forward through the unlocked door and continued moving forward until reaching the purple box. I should have avoided turning right multiple times, which led to revisiting the same positions."
