      "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left at time 21 to face west, then moved forward to (4, 4), and continued moving forward until reaching the purple box at (8, 1). I should have avoided turning right multiple times, which led to revisiting the same positions. By moving forward from (5, 4) towards the west, I would have saved time and reached the purple box more efficiently.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left at time 21 to face east, then moved forward until reaching the green key at (4, 3), and used it to unlock the green locked door at (5, 4).
