   "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned right at time 21 to head towards the box's location. Then, I should have continued going forward until reaching the box's row, and turned left to align myself with the box. Finally, I should have gone forward to reach the box and picked it up, instead of turning left and right unnecessarily and running out of time."
