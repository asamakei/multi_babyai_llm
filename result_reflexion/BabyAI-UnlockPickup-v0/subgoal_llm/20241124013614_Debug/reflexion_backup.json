   "I planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['move right', 'explore right', 'pick up item', 'pick up key', 'move east', 'go south', 'go south', 'move forward', 'use key', 'use green key', 'unlock green door', 'go through green door', 'go east', 'move east', 'go east', 'move east', 'find purple box', 'move forward', 'move north', 'move north', 'move forward', 'move right', 'move to (8, 1)'], but was not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['move back', 'drop green key', 'drop item', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible'].\nTo achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box. This would have allowed me to free up my inventory and successfully pick up the purple box. Additionally, I should have planned a more direct route to the purple box, avoiding unnecessary movements and explorations. By doing so, I would have saved time and resources, ultimately leading to a successful completion of the task."
