You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['Go to green key', 'Pick up the green key', 'Get green key', 'Get the key at (4, 3).', 'Get the green key', 'Go to (4, 4)', 'Go to (4, 4)', 'Go around to the green locked door', 'Go to (5, 4)', 'Go to the green locked door', 'Use green key on the green locked door', 'open the green locked door', 'Use green key on green locked door', 'Open the green locked door', 'Go through the green door to the east', 'Go through green door', 'Go through the green door', 'Go to (7, 1)', 'Go east to the purple box', 'Go to (8, 1)', 'Go to the purple box', \"drop the key you're holding\", 'drop the green key', 'Pick up the purple box in front of you', 'Pick up the purple box', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: []. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. \nGive your plan:"

    "Based on the given history, I can see that the main issue was that I couldn't pick up the purple box because I was already carrying the green key. To improve the plan, I would suggest adding a subgoal to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Drop the green key\n8. Pick up the purple box\n\nBy adding the subgoal to drop the green key, I should be able to pick up the purple box and complete the mission."
