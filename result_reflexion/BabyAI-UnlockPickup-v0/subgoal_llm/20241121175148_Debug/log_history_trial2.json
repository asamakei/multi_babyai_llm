  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",
