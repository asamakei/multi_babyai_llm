Pick up the purple box\n\nHowever, I noticed that the 'drop the carrying item to forward' action failed multiple times. This could be due to the fact that the action was repeated multiple times without changing the situation. To improve this, I would suggest adding a check to see if the item has already been dropped before attempting to drop it again. This would prevent the agent from getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere's an updated plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4.

To improve the plan, I would suggest adding a subgoal to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3.

Pick up the purple box\n\nBy adding the subgoal to drop the green key, I should be able to pick up the purple box and complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nBased on the given history, I can see that the main issue was that I couldn't pick up the purple box because I was already carrying the green key.

Pick up the purple box\n\nHowever, I noticed that the 'drop the carrying item to forward' action failed multiple times. This could be due to the fact that the action was repeated multiple times without changing the situation. To improve this, I would suggest adding a check to see if the item has already been dropped before attempting to drop it again. This would prevent the agent from getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere's an updated plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4.

Pick up the purple box\n\nHowever, I noticed that the 'drop the carrying item to forward' action failed multiple times. This could be due to the fact that the action was repeated multiple times without changing the situation. To improve this, I would suggest adding a check to see if the item has already been dropped before attempting to drop it again. This would prevent the agent from getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere's an updated plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4.

Pick up the purple box\n\nHowever, I noticed that the 'drop the carrying item to forward' action failed multiple times. This could be due to the fact that the action was repeated multiple times without changing the situation. To improve this, I would suggest adding a check to see if the item has already been dropped before attempting to drop it again.

To improve the plan, I would suggest adding a subgoal to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Drop the green key\n8. Pick up the purple box\n\nBy adding the subgoal to drop the green key, I should be able to pick up the purple box and complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nBased on the given history, I can see that the main issue was that I couldn't pick up the purple box because I was already carrying the green key. To improve the plan, I would suggest adding a subgoal to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Drop the green key\n8. Pick up the purple box\n\nBy adding the subgoal to drop the green key, I should be able to pick up the purple box and complete the mission.\n\nNow, I will start the new trial. I am at (4, 2). My forward is (4, 3). My right is (3, 2) My left is (5, 2). I have no item. There is no object in my forward.\n\nMy first action is to go forward.\nTrial 2:\nBased on the given history, I can see that the main issue was that I couldn't pick up the purple box because I was already carrying the green key.

Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Drop the green key\n8. Pick up the purple box\n\nHowever, I noticed that the 'drop the carrying item to forward' action failed multiple times. This could be due to the fact that the action was repeated multiple times without changing the situation. To improve this, I would suggest adding a check to see if the item has already been dropped before attempting to drop it again. This would prevent the agent from getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere's an updated plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Check if green key is being carried\n8. If green key is being carried, drop the green key\n9.

   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nBased on the given history, I can see that the main issue was that I couldn't pick up the purple box because I was already carrying the green key. To improve the plan, I would suggest adding a subgoal to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Drop the green key\n8. Pick up the purple box\n\nBy adding the subgoal to drop the green key, I should be able to pick up the purple box and complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nBased on the given history, I can see that the main issue was that I couldn't pick up the purple box because I was already carrying the green key. To improve the plan, I would suggest adding a subgoal to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Drop the green key\n8. Pick up the purple box\n\nBy adding the subgoal to drop the green key, I should be able to pick up the purple box and complete the mission.\n\nNow, I will start the new trial. I am at (4, 2). My forward is (4, 3). My right is (3, 2) My left is (5, 2). I have no item. There is no object in my forward.\n\nMy first action is to go forward.\nTrial 2:\nBased on the given history, I can see that the main issue was that I couldn't pick up the purple box because I was already carrying the green key. To improve the plan, I would suggest adding a subgoal to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Drop the green key\n8. Pick up the purple box\n\nHowever, I noticed that the 'drop the carrying item to forward' action failed multiple times. This could be due to the fact that the action was repeated multiple times without changing the situation. To improve this, I would suggest adding a check to see if the item has already been dropped before attempting to drop it again. This would prevent the agent from getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere's an updated plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Check if green key is being carried\n8. If green key is being carried, drop the green key\n9.
