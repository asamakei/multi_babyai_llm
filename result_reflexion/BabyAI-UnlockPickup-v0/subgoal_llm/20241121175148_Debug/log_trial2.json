You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['Go to (4, 3)', 'Go to green key', 'Find the green key', 'Go to green key', 'Pick up the green key', 'Go to the door', 'Go to the green locked door', 'Go to (5, 4)', 'Go to green locked door', 'Open green locked door', 'Use green key on green locked door', 'Use the key on the door', 'Open the door', 'Go through the green open door', 'Go through green door to the east', 'Go through green door', 'Go through the green door to the east', 'Head east to purple box', 'go to (7, 1)', 'Go down to (7, 1)', 'Go down', 'Go down to purple box', 'Go to (8, 2)', 'Head east to purple box', 'Go to the purple box', 'Go down to purple box', 'Go to (8, 1)', 'Go to purple box', 'Drop green key to free hands.', 'Drop green key to make space', 'Drop green key to make space for purple box', 'drop the green key', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: []. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved.

    "Based on the given history, I can see that the main issue was that I couldn't pick up the purple box because I was already carrying the green key. To improve the plan, I would suggest adding a subgoal to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Drop the green key\n8. Pick up the purple box\n\nBy adding the subgoal to drop the green key, I should be able to pick up the purple box and complete the mission.",

Pick up the purple box\n\nHowever, I noticed that the 'drop the carrying item to forward' action failed multiple times. This could be due to the fact that the action was repeated multiple times without changing the situation. To improve this, I would suggest adding a check to see if the item has already been dropped before attempting to drop it again. This would prevent the agent from getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere's an updated plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Check if green key is being carried\n8. If green key is being carried, drop the green key\n9. Pick up the purple box\n\nThis revised plan should help the agent to complete the task more efficiently and avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop."
