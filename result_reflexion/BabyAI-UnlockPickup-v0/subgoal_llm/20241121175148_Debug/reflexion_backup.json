   "Based on the given history, I can see that the main issue was that I couldn't pick up the purple box because I was already carrying the green key. To improve the plan, I would suggest adding a subgoal to drop the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box.\n\nHere's a revised plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7. Drop the green key\n8. Pick up the purple box\n\nBy adding the subgoal to drop the green key, I should be able to pick up the purple box and complete the mission.\n\nNow, I will start the new trial. I am at (4, 2). My forward is (4, 3). My right is (3, 2) My left is (5, 2). I have no item. There is no object in my forward.\n\nMy first action is to go forward.",

Pick up the purple box\n\nHowever, I noticed that the 'drop the carrying item to forward' action failed multiple times. This could be due to the fact that the action was repeated multiple times without changing the situation. To improve this, I would suggest adding a check to see if the item has already been dropped before attempting to drop it again. This would prevent the agent from getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nHere's an updated plan:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4.

If green key is being carried, drop the green key\n9. Pick up the purple box\n\nThis revised plan should help the agent to complete the task more efficiently and avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop.",

For example, the agent could be programmed to turn around and go back to the starting point if it encounters a wall or an obstacle.\n\nHere's an updated plan with the additional subgoals:\n\n1. Go to green key\n2. Pick up the green key\n3. Go to the green locked door\n4. Use green key on the green locked door\n5. Go through the green door to the east\n6. Go to the purple box\n7.

If stuck in a loop, turn around and go back to the starting point\n\nThis"
