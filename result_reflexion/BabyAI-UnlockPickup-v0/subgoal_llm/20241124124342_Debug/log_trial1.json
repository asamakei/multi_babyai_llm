You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list ['get green key', 'get key', 'go east', 'go around wall', 'go to green door', 'go west', 'go to green door', 'go east', 'go to green door', 'go around wall', 'go around wall', 'go around wall', 'go to green door', 'go to green door', 'unlock door', 'unlock green door', 'go through door', 'move east', 'move east']. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['move down', 'move to purple box location', 'go to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output your plan in 3 to 6 sentences and output new subgoal list briefly in the format ['A', 'B', 'C', ...] for achievement the task. \nGive your plan and list:"

    "To achieve the mission of picking up the purple box, I should have planned a more efficient route to the box's location. Upon obtaining the green key and unlocking the green door, I should have turned left and moved down towards the purple box instead of moving east again. This would have allowed me to reach the box's location sooner and pick it up before running out of time.\n\nNew subgoal list: ['move down after unlocking door','move to purple box location directly', 'go to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']"
