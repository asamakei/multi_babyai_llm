Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\nHere is the task:\nachieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible\nThe following is your history:\ntime 41:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".
