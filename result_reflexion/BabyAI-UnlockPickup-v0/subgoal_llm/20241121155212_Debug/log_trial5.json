   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible, I plan to head east from the starting point to reach the green key. After acquiring the key, I will navigate to the green locked door and use the key to unlock it. Then, I will go through the door and continue east to reach the purple box. Once I reach the location of the purple box, I will pick it up to complete the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible, I plan to head east from the starting point to reach the green key.

You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['Go to green key', 'Head east to the green key', 'Pick up green key', 'Pick up the green key', 'Head north to the green locked door', 'open the door', 'go through the door', 'go north', 'Head east to the green locked door', 'Go to green locked door', 'Head east']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go to (8, 1)', 'Head east and then go north', 'Head east to (8, 1)', 'Go east to purple box', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal strategy to complete the task. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
