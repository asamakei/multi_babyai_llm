You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time.

However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['Head to purple box', 'Go east to purple box', 'Head east to purple box', 'Go east', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal strategy to complete the task. You will need this later when you are solving the same task.
