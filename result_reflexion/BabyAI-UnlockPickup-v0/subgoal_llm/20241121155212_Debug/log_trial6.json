You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['Head east to the green key', 'go to the green key', 'Pick up the green key', 'Pick up the green key in front of you.', 'Pick up green key', 'pick up the green key', 'go north', 'Head east to the green locked door', 'go to the green locked door', 'Open the green locked door', 'Use the green key to unlock the green locked door', 'open the door in front of you', 'open the green locked door', 'go east through door', 'go through the green open door', 'go through the door', 'go east', 'Head east to column 8']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['Head east to row 8', 'Head east to column 8', 'Head east to purple box', 'go east', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal strategy to complete the task. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
