You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['Reach key to unlock', 'Reach green key', 'Acquire key', 'Pick up the green key', 'Go east to door', 'Turn right to the green locked door']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['Go through the green door', 'Go to the green locked door', 'Unlock green door', 'Head east to purple box', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal strategy to complete the task. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

I will navigate through the grid, avoiding walls and using the green key to unlock the door if necessary. Once I reach the location of the purple box, I will pick it up to complete the mission.",
