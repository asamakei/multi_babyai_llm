  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To achieve the mission, I should have planned to go around the wall to reach the purple box instead of trying to go through the green door. I should have added subgoals to move south and then east to reach the purple box. Additionally, I should have planned to move more efficiently to the green key and then to the purple box, instead of moving back and forth. By doing so, I would have achieved the subgoals of going to the purple box and completing the mission.",
