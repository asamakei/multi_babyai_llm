   "To achieve the mission, I should have planned to go around the wall to reach the purple box instead of trying to go through the green door. I should have added subgoals to move south and then east to reach the purple box. Additionally, I should have planned to move more efficiently to the green key and then to the purple box, instead of moving back and forth. By doing so, I would have achieved the subgoals of going to the purple box and completing the mission."
