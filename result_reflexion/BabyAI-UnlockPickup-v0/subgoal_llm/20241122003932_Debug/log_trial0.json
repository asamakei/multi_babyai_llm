You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move west', 'go to (1,3)', 'move west', 'go to (1, 2)', 'move north', 'go to (1, 1)', 'move north', 'move east', 'move east', 'move east', 'move to green key', 'go to green key', 'Turn right and pick up the green key', 'go to the green key', 'Turn right and go up to the green key', 'move to the green key', 'move to the green key', 'Pick up the green key in front of you.', 'pick up the green key', 'move to green key', 'Use green key to unlock green locked door', 'Unlock green locked door', 'Go to green locked door', 'Turn left.', 'Go to green key.', 'go through the green door']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go to (8, 1)', 'go to purple box', 'Achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the mission, I should have planned to go around the wall to reach the purple box instead of trying to go through the green door. I should have added subgoals to move south and then east to reach the purple box. Additionally, I should have planned to move more efficiently to the green key and then to the purple box, instead of moving back and forth. By doing so, I would have achieved the subgoals of going to the purple box and completing the mission."
