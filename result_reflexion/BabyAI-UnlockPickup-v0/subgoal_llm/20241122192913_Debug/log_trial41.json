You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go right', 'go to green key', 'pick up green key in forward', 'pick up green key', 'go to (4, 3)', 'go right', 'go to (5, 4)', 'go to green door', 'go to green door', 'open door', 'use green key', 'open door in forward', 'go down', 'go down to (3, 1)', 'go down', 'go down to (3, 1)', 'go down', 'go right', 'go right']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go right to (8, 1)', 'go down to (8, 1)', 'go to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

I should have planned to go right to (7, 3) and then go down to (8, 1) to reach the purple box. Additionally, I should have avoided unnecessary movements and focused on a direct path to the green key, then the green door, and finally the purple box.",
