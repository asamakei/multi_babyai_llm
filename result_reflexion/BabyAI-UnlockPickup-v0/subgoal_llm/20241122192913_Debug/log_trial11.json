Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the green key as soon as possible and then used it to unlock the green door. After unlocking the door, I should have dropped the green key to free up space and then proceeded to pick up the purple box. Additionally, I should have avoided unnecessary movements and focused on a direct path to the green key and then the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the green key as soon as possible and then used it to unlock the green door.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move east', 'move to (4,3)', 'go to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move forward', 'go to (4,3)', 'move east', 'move to (4,4)', 'go to green locked door', 'go to green locked door', 'use green key', 'open green locked door', 'go through green door', 'move east', 'go to (6, 4)', 'move east', 'go to (7, 4)', 'move east', 'go to (7, 3)', 'move north', 'go to (7, 2)', 'move north', 'move to (8, 1)', 'move right', 'go to purple box', 'move left', 'move left', 'drop key by moving to a space with no object', 'go right', 'go right', 'move right', 'go left', 'move left', 'go left']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go left', 'move left', 'drop key', 'drop green key', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
