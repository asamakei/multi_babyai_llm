You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go right', 'pick up green key', 'pick up green key', 'go down', 'go down', 'go down', 'go down to (1, 5)', 'go down', 'turn around', 'turn back and go to green locked door', 'move right', 'go right', 'go to green locked door', 'go to (3, 4)', 'go right', 'go to green locked door', 'open green locked door with key', 'open green locked door', 'go right', 'go down', 'go down', 'go down to (6, 1)', 'go right']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go right', 'go to (8, 1)', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
