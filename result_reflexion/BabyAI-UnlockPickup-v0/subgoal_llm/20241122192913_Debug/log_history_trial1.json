  "To achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the purple box as soon as possible. I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box, as it was blocking my ability to pick up new items. I should have also avoided unnecessary movements, such as going north and then back south, and instead focused on a direct path to the purple box. Additionally, I should have utilized the open green door to my advantage, potentially using it as a shortcut to reach the purple box.",
