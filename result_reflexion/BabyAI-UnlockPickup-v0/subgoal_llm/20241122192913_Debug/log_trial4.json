However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go north', 'go to (5, 4)', 'move to green locked door', 'move to (4, 4)', 'move to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task.
