You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move right', 'move to green key', 'get green key', 'pick up green key', 'move to green door', 'move forward', 'move to green door', 'use green key', 'open green locked door with green key', 'open green locked door', 'open door', 'go through door', 'move forward', 'move east', 'move forward', 'move forward', 'move to (6, 4)', 'move east', 'move east', 'move down to (7, 3)', 'move down', 'move down', 'go down', 'move down to (7, 1)', 'move right to (8, 2)', 'move right', 'go right', 'move left', 'move to (8, 1)']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['move down to (8, 1)', 'move down', 'go down', 'move forward', 'pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
