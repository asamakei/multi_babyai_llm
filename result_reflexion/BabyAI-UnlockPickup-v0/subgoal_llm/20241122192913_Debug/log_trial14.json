There is wall in your forward.\n> turn left\nYou turned left.\nresult: FALIED\nYou are agent0. You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go right', 'move to green key', 'go to green key', 'get green key', 'pick up green key', 'go right', 'go to green door', 'go to green door', 'go to (4, 4)', 'go east', 'go to green door', 'use key to open', 'open green door', 'go east', 'go down', 'go up to (6, 1)', 'go up', 'go left']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go down to (6, 1)', 'go down', 'go to (8, 1)', 'go to purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the green key as soon as possible and then used it to unlock the green door. After unlocking the door, I should have dropped the green key to free up space and then proceeded to pick up the purple box. I should have also avoided unnecessary movements and focused on a direct path to the green key and then the purple box. Additionally, I should have utilized the open green door to my advantage, potentially using it as a shortcut to reach the purple box.",
