   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on going down to (8, 1) after picking up the green key, then picking up the purple box. I should have planned to go down directly after picking up the green key, instead of going right and then down. Additionally, I should have avoided unnecessary movements and focused on a direct path to the purple box, and also planned to open the green locked door using the green key before proceeding further.\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on going down to (8, 1) after picking up the green key, then picking up the purple box.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go right', 'go to green key', 'pick up green key', 'go to (3, 1)', 'go down', 'go down to (3, 1)', 'go right', 'go to green locked door', 'go to (3, 2)', 'go right', 'go to green locked door', 'go right', 'go right']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go up', 'go to (5, 4)', 'open green locked door', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
