   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

After unlocking the door, I should have dropped the green key to free up space and then proceeded to go through the open green door to reach the lower level. From there, I should have moved down to (5, 1) and then gone right to reach the purple box, thus achieving the mission.\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the purple box as soon as possible after unlocking the green door.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go right', 'go to green key', 'pick up green key', 'go right', 'go down to (3, 4)', 'go down', 'go to green locked door', 'go right to (2, 4)', 'go right', 'go to (1, 4)', 'go right to (1, 3)', 'go right', 'go to green locked door', 'go east', 'go to green locked door', 'go east', 'go to green locked door', 'go east', 'go to (5, 4)', 'go to green locked door', 'use green key', 'open green locked door', 'go down to (4, 5)', 'go down', 'go down', 'go down', 'go down to (4, 1)', 'go down', 'go down', 'go down to (4, 1)', 'move right']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go right', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
