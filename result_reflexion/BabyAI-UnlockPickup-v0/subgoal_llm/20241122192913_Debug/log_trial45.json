You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go right', 'pick up green key', 'go down', 'go to green locked door', 'go right to (4, 1)', 'go right', 'go right to (5, 1)', 'go to green locked door', 'go to green locked door', 'go right to (4, 3)', 'go right', 'go down', 'go down', 'go down to (4, 4)', 'go to green locked door', 'go left to (5, 4)', 'go left', 'open door with green key', 'use green key', 'open green locked door', 'open door with green key', 'go right to (5, 1)', 'go right', 'go right', 'go right', 'go right']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go right to (8, 0)', 'go down', 'go down to (8, 1)', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
