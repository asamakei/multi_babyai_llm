You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'pick up green key', 'pick up green key', 'move to (3, 4)', 'move right', 'move to (5, 4) to unlock green door', 'use green key', 'open green door', 'go through green open door', 'move down', 'move down', 'move down', 'move down']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['move right', 'move right to (8, 4)', 'move down to (8, 1)', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
