You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'pick up green key', 'move down', 'move to (3, 1)', 'move left', 'move to (2, 0)', 'move right', 'go to (2, 1)', 'move to (2, 0)']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['use green key to open green locked door', 'open green locked door', 'move down to (3, 2)', 'go down', 'move down', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the mission, I should have focused on going down to (8, 1) after picking up the green key, then picking up the purple box. I should have planned to go down directly after picking up the green key, instead of going right and then down. Additionally, I should have avoided unnecessary movements and focused on a direct path to the purple box, and also planned to open the green locked door using the green key before proceeding further.",
