I should have moved down to (7, 1) and then moved right to reach the purple box, thus achieving the mission. Additionally, I should have avoided unnecessary movements and focused on a direct path to the green key and then the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the green key and then using it to unlock the green door. After unlocking the door, I should have dropped the green key to free up space and then proceeded to go through the open green door to reach the lower level.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move right', 'move to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move to green locked door', 'move to green locked door', 'use green key', 'open green locked door', 'move down to (5, 5)', 'move down to (5, 5)', 'move down', 'move down', 'go down', 'go down to (7, 1)', 'go right', 'move right to (8, 2)', 'go right', 'move left to purple box', 'go left', 'drop item', 'drop green key']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['pick up purple box', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
