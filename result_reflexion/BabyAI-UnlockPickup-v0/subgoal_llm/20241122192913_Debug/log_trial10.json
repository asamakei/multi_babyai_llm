   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the purple box as soon as possible. I should have dropped the green key before attempting to pick up the purple box, as it was blocking my ability to pick up new items. I should have also avoided unnecessary movements, such as going north and then back south, and instead focused on a direct path to the purple box. Additionally, I should have utilized the open green door to my advantage, potentially using it as a shortcut to reach the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the green key as soon as possible and then used it to unlock the green door.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go to green key', 'pick up green key', 'go south', 'go east', 'go to green locked door', 'use green key on green door', 'use green key', 'open green door', 'go east', 'go to (6, 4)', 'go east', 'go to (7, 4)', 'go east', 'go north', 'go north', 'go to (8, 1)', 'go to (8, 1)', 'go to purple box', 'pick up purple box']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['drop green key', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
