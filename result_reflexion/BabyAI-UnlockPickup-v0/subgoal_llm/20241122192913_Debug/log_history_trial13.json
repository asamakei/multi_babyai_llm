  "To achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the green key and then using it to unlock the green door. After unlocking the door, I should have dropped the green key to free up space and then proceeded to pick up the purple box. I should have also avoided unnecessary movements and focused on a direct path to the green key and then the purple box. Additionally, I should have utilized the open green door to my advantage, potentially using it as a shortcut to reach the purple box.",
