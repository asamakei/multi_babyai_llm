  "To achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the green key and then using it to unlock the green door. After unlocking the door, I should have dropped the green key to free up space and then proceeded to go through the open green door to reach the lower level. From there, I should have moved down to (5, 1) and then gone right to reach the purple box, thus achieving the mission. Additionally, I should have avoided unnecessary movements and focused on a direct path to the green key and then the purple box.",
