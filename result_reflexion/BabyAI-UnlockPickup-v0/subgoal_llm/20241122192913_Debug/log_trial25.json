Additionally, I should have avoided unnecessary movements and focused on a direct path to the green key and then the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nTo achieve the mission, I should have focused on picking up the green key and then using it to unlock the green door.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['go right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'go to green key', 'pick up green key', 'go down', 'go to green locked door', 'go to green locked door', 'open green locked door', 'move down', 'go down']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go through green door', 'go through door', 'go down to (4, 5)', 'move down', 'go down', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"
