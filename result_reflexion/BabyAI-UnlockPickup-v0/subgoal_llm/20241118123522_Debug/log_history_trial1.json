  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

  "To achieve the mission, I should have turned right at time 21 to face the green open door at (5, 4) and then gone through it. Then, I should have continued moving forward and explored the area to find the purple box, instead of going left and right repeatedly. Additionally, I should have prioritized going down to reach the lower rows, as the mission was to pick up the purple box, which might be located at a lower position.",
