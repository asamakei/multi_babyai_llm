   "To achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should have dropped the green key before trying to pick up the purple box. I should have added 'drop the green key' as a subgoal after 'pick up green key' to free up space to pick up the purple box. Additionally, I should have added 'go to (7, 1)' as a subgoal after 'drop the green key' to reach the location of the purple box. By adding these subgoals, I would have been able to pick up the purple box and achieve the mission.",
