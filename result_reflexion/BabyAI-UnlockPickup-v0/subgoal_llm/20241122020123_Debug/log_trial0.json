You will be given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. You were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list: ['move right', 'move to (4, 3)', 'go to green key', 'pick up green key', 'move right', 'go east', 'move to (5, 4)', 'move forward', 'go east', 'move forward', 'go south', 'move to (5, 4)', 'use green key', 'open green locked door', 'open the door', 'move forward', 'go east', 'go east', 'move forward', 'go east', 'move to (8, 4)', 'go east', 'move forward', 'go north', 'move forward', 'go north', 'go back to (7, 2)', 'drop key', 'drop green key', 'drop the green key', 'pick up the purple box']. However, the following subgoal list was not achieved: ['go to (7, 1)', 'go to (5, 4)', 'drop the green key', 'achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering concretely subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, consider how it could have been achieved. You will need this later when you are solving the same task. Output only your plan in 3 to 6 sentences. \nGive your plan:"

    "To achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should have dropped the green key before trying to pick up the purple box. I should have added 'drop the green key' as a subgoal after 'pick up green key' to free up space to pick up the purple box. Additionally, I should have added 'go to (7, 1)' as a subgoal after 'drop the green key' to reach the location of the purple box. By adding these subgoals, I would have been able to pick up the purple box and achieve the mission."
