  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To achieve the mission as soon as possible, I should have dropped the green key before trying to pick up the purple box. I should have added 'drop the green key' as a subgoal after 'pick up green key' to free up space to pick up the purple box. Additionally, I should have added 'go to (7, 1)' as a subgoal after 'drop the green key' to reach the location of the purple box. By adding these subgoals, I would have been able to pick up the purple box and achieve the mission.",
