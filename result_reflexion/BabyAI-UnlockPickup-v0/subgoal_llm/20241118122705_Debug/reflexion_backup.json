   "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have taken a different approach. Instead of repeatedly trying to pick up the item in forward or going forward, I should have turned left or right to explore alternative paths and find a way around the walls blocking my forward direction. By doing so, I may have found a clear path to the purple box, allowing me to successfully pick it up."
