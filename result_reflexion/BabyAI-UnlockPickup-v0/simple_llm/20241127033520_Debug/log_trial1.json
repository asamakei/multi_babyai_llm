   "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects.

You are given the history of a past experience in which you were placed in an environment and given a task to complete. In this trial, you were unsuccessful in completing the task because of running out of time. You planned and accomplished the following subgoal list []. However, You were not able to achieve the following subgoal list ['achieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible']. Do not summarize your environment, but rather think about the subgoal planning strategy to complete the task, considering subgoals that are useful and those that should be improved. For each subgoal that was not achieved, which was particularly useful output your new plan in the form of \"'B' is necessary to achieve 'A'. 'C' is necessary to achieve 'B'. 'D' is neccesary to achieve 'C'. ...\". \nGive only result:"
