  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left at time 28 and headed north to reach the purple box at (8, 1) instead of going forward and then turning left. This would have saved time and allowed me to reach the box before running out of time. Additionally, I should have also considered the position of the purple box earlier and planned my route accordingly to avoid unnecessary turns and steps.",
