  "Interact with an grid world environment to solve a task. The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.",

  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left at time 28 and headed north to reach the purple box at (8, 1) instead of going forward and then turning left. This would have saved time and allowed me to reach the box before running out of time. Additionally, I should have also considered the position of the purple box earlier and planned my route accordingly to avoid unnecessary turns and steps.",
