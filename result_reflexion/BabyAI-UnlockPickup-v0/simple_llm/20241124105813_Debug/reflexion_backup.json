   "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone through the green open door at (5, 4) instead of turning left and right multiple times. After passing through the door, I should have turned left to head towards the purple box at (8, 1) and then moved forward to pick it up. Additionally, I should have avoided turning back and instead focused on moving towards the purple box in a more direct path."
