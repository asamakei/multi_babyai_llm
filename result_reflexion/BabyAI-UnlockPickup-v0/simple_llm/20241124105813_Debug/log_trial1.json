The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone through the green open door at (5, 4) instead of turning left and right multiple times. After passing through the door, I should have turned left to head towards the purple box at (8, 1) and then moved forward to pick it up.
