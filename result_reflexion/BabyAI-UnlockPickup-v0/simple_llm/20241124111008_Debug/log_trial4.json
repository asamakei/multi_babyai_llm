The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo accomplish the task, I should have turned left after passing through the green open door at (5, 4) and moved towards the purple box at (8, 1) to get closer to it. Then, I should have turned right to face the correct direction and moved forward to pick up the purple box. Additionally, I should have moved down to reach the correct y-coordinate of the purple box instead of moving up.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task, I should have moved forward to the passable floor at (5, 1) after turning right at time 25, then moved forward to reach the green door at (5, 4) and used the green key to unlock it. After unlocking the door, I should have moved forward to access the area where the purple box is located and moved towards the purple box to pick it up, instead of turning right again at time 26. I should have also moved down to the correct y-coordinate of the purple box instead of moving up.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I should have moved up to the passable floor at (4, 2), then moved up to the passable floor at (4, 3), then moved up to the passable floor at (4, 4), then moved right to the green door at (5, 4) and used the green key to unlock it, then moved forward to access the area where the purple box is located and moved towards the purple box to pick it up.
