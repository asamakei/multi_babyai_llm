The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left to face east earlier and gone forward to move through the unlocked space, then turned right to face south and continued going forward until I reached the purple box. I should have avoided going forward when there was a wall in my forward direction and instead turned left to face east to move around the wall. Additionally, I should have picked up the purple box when it was in my forward direction instead of going forward again.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have gone forward from (8, 4) to (8, 1) and then picked up the purple box. However, I repeated the 'pick up the item in forward' action multiple times without success. A new plan would be to go forward from (6, 4) to (8, 4), then turn left to face north, go forward from (8, 4) to (8, 1), and finally pick up the purple box.\nTrial 2:\nTo accomplish the task, I should have gone forward from (5, 4) to (8, 4), then turned left to face north, and gone forward from (8, 4) to (8, 1) to reach the row where the purple box is located.
