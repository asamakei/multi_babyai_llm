  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left to face east earlier and gone forward to move through the unlocked space, then turned right to face south and continued going forward until I reached the purple box. I should have avoided going forward when there was a wall in my forward direction and instead turned left to face east to move around the wall. Additionally, I should have picked up the purple box when it was in my forward direction instead of going forward again.",

However, I repeated the 'pick up the item in forward' action multiple times without success. A new plan would be to go forward from (6, 4) to (8, 4), then turn left to face north, go forward from (8, 4) to (8, 1), and finally pick up the purple box.",
