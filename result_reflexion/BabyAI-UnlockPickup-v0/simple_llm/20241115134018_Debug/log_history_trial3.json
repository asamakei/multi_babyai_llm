  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left to face east earlier and gone forward to move through the unlocked space. Then, I should have turned right to face south and continued going forward until I reached the purple box.

  "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have turned left to face east earlier and gone forward to move through the unlocked space, then turned right to face south and continued going forward until I reached the purple box. I should have avoided going forward when there was a wall in my forward direction and instead turned left to face east to move around the wall. Additionally, I should have picked up the purple box when it was in my forward direction instead of going forward again.",
