The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I plan to prioritize finding the key to unlock the green door, as it may be a shortcut to the purple box. I will thoroughly explore the area around the green locked door and search for any clues or objects that could help me find the key. Additionally, I will consider moving east and then south to see if I can find any other paths that may lead me to the key or the purple box, rather than getting stuck in a loop.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I plan to prioritize exploring the area east of my starting position, as it seems I got stuck in a loop in the west area. I will make sure to go back to the green locked door and try to open it again with the green key, as it could be a shortcut to the purple box.

The grid (0,0) is at the northwest end, (10, 0) is northeast, (0, 5) is southwest, (10, 5) is southeast. You cannot go through objects. Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I plan to prioritize finding the key to unlock the green door, as it may be a shortcut to the purple box. I will thoroughly explore the area around the green locked door and search for any clues or objects that could help me find the key. Additionally, I will consider moving east and then south to see if I can find any other paths that may lead me to the key or the purple box, rather than getting stuck in a loop.\nTrial 1:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I plan to prioritize exploring the area east of my starting position, as it seems I got stuck in a loop in the west area. I will make sure to go back to the green locked door and try to open it again with the green key, as it could be a shortcut to the purple box.
