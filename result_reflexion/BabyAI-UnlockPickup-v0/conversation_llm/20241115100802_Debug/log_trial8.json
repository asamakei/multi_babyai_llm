I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle. I should have checked the gap between the wall and the purple box earlier to see if I could fit through it. I will make sure to explore the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly and consider moving north to get closer to the purple box.\nTrial 2:\nTo improve my chances of picking up the purple box, I should have prioritized exploring the area east of the green locked door more thoroughly and efficiently.

I should have also tried moving east from my current position to see if I can get closer to the box.
