I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. Additionally, I should have kept a closer eye on the green open door and considered moving west to get closer to it, as it might have given me another option to reach the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to prioritize exploring the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly, as I suspect the green key or purple box might be hidden there. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle.

I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I plan to prioritize exploring the area east of my starting position more thoroughly and efficiently. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. Additionally, I should have kept a closer eye on the green open door and considered moving west to get closer to it, as it might have given me another option to reach the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to prioritize exploring the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly, as I suspect the green key or purple box might be hidden there. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle. I should have checked the gap between the wall and the purple box earlier to see if I could fit through it. I will make sure to explore the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly and consider moving north to get closer to the purple box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 4:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".

I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. Additionally, I should have kept a closer eye on the green open door and considered moving west to get closer to it, as it might have given me another option to reach the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to prioritize exploring the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly, as I suspect the green key or purple box might be hidden there. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle.

Additionally, I should have kept a closer eye on the green open door and considered moving west to get closer to it, as it might have given me another option to reach the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to prioritize exploring the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly, as I suspect the green key or purple box might be hidden there. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle. I should have checked the gap between the wall and the purple box earlier to see if I could fit through it.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I plan to prioritize exploring the area east of my starting position more thoroughly and efficiently. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. Additionally, I should have kept a closer eye on the green open door and considered moving west to get closer to it, as it might have given me another option to reach the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to prioritize exploring the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly, as I suspect the green key or purple box might be hidden there. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle. I should have checked the gap between the wall and the purple box earlier to see if I could fit through it. I will make sure to explore the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly and consider moving north to get closer to the purple box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 17:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".

Additionally, I should have kept a closer eye on the green open door and considered moving west to get closer to it, as it might have given me another option to reach the purple box.\\nTrial 1:\\nMy new plan is to prioritize exploring the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly, as I suspect the green key or purple box might be hidden there. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.\\nTrial 2:\\nMy new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle.

Each step, You must select actions in 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go forward', 'pick up the item in forward', 'drop the carrying item to forward' or 'open the door in forward'.\n\nYour memory for the task below:\nTrial 0:\nTo complete the task of picking up the purple box, I plan to prioritize exploring the area east of my starting position more thoroughly and efficiently. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. Additionally, I should have kept a closer eye on the green open door and considered moving west to get closer to it, as it might have given me another option to reach the purple box.\nTrial 1:\nMy new plan is to prioritize exploring the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly, as I suspect the green key or purple box might be hidden there. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.\nTrial 2:\nMy new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle. I should have checked the gap between the wall and the purple box earlier to see if I could fit through it. I will make sure to explore the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly and consider moving north to get closer to the purple box.\nHere is the task:\nAchieve the \"mission\" as soon as possible.\ntime 20:\nYour mission is \"pick up the purple box\".
