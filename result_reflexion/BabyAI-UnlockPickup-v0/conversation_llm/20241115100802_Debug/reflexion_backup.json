   "I should have explored the area around the green locked door more thoroughly before proceeding. Upon reaching the green locked door, I should have turned right and moved east to explore the area behind the wall, instead of moving south. This would have potentially led me to find the purple box or another passage.",
   "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have moved south to get around the wall and approach the purple box from a different angle, rather than trying to pick it up from the same position. I should have also tried moving east from my current position to see if I can get closer to the box. Additionally, I should have considered the gap between the wall and the purple box and planned my movements accordingly to avoid getting stuck.",
   "To complete the task of picking up the purple box, I should have prioritized exploring the area around the green locked door more thoroughly. I should have turned right and moved east to explore the area behind the wall, instead of moving south. Additionally, I should have tried moving east from my current position to see if I can get closer to the purple box or find any other passage, and then turned left to head north to navigate around the wall at (5, 4) and the green locked door."

   "My new plan is to prioritize exploring the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly, as I suspect the green key or purple box might be hidden there. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. I will also make sure to check the area north of my starting position to see if I can find any other paths or objects that could aid me in my mission.",
   "My new plan is to move south first to get around the wall, then move east to approach the purple box from a different angle. I should have checked the gap between the wall and the purple box earlier to see if I could fit through it. I will make sure to explore the area west of the green locked door more thoroughly and consider moving north to get closer to the purple box.",
   "To improve my chances of picking up the purple box, I should have prioritized exploring the area east of the green locked door more thoroughly and efficiently. I should have moved south and then east earlier to avoid getting stuck between the walls and to have a clearer path to the purple box. Additionally, I should have kept a closer eye on the green open door and considered moving west to get closer to it, as it might have given me another option to reach the purple box."
